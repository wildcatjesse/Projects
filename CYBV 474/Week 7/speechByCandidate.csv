Bernie Sanders,Well  you're right  the economy is doing really great for people like Mr  Bloomberg and other billionaires  In the last three years  last three years  billionaires in this country saw an  850 billion increase in their wealth  But you know what  for the ordinary American things are not so good  Last year  real wage increases for the average worker were less than one percent  Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck  87 million Americans have no health insurance or are under insured  45 million people are struggling with student debt  500 000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street  including 30 000 veterans  That is not an economy that's working for the American people  That's an economy working for the one percent  We're going to create an economy for all  not just wealthy campaign contributors  59 Oh  Mr  Bloomberg  Let me tell Mr  Putin  Okay  I'm not a good friend of President Xi of China  I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader  And let me tell Mr  Putin who interfered in the 2016 election  try to bring Americans against Americans  Hey  Mr  Putin  if I'm President of the United States  trust me you're not going to interfere in anymore American elections  27 Pete mentioned   I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight  I wonder why and maybe  Pete mentions what the American people want  I will tell you  Pete  what the American people want and Joe what the American people want  they don't want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding  19 Pete has gotten funding  crosstalk 00 08 42  from 50 billionaires  Joe I think  has gotten a little bit more  What the American people want by the way  and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago  Raising the minimum wage to a living wage  15 bucks an hour  making public colleges and universities tuition free and finally doing what every other major country on Earth does  guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right to a Medicare For All single payer system  crosstalk 00 00 09 14   37 I didn't say that  Pete  1 Good  0 Thank you  0 Over a 10 year period  0 How many hours do you have  2 The answer is  0 No  that's not the problem  All right  let's talk about Medicare for All  I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University published in Lancet magazine  one of the prestigious medical journals in the world  You know what it said  Medicare for All will lower healthcare costs in this country by  450 billion a year and save 68 000 lives of people who otherwise would have died  30 What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does  guarantee healthcare to all people  not have thousands of separate insurance plans  which are costing us some  500 billion a year to administer  Our plan  we have laid out options all over the place  One of the options is a seven and a half percent payroll tax on employers  which will save them substantial sums of money  Another tax  30 You asked me a question  1 First of all  1 I think that she's talking about me  0 Look  first of all  0 I think  Tom  I think she was talking about my plan  not yours  3 Let's talk about math  1 Let's talk about math  0 Doing nothing is what   Excuse me  can I respond to the attack  3 The moderator guys  1 The moderator   Is it my turn  3 Okay  What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing healthcare costs  what recent Yale study has said  is that your program would cost some  50 trillion over a 10 year period  We would continue to pay  in some cases  10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs  What every study out there  conservative or progressive says  Medicare for All will save money  Ours will cost about 45 billion  not 60 trillion   crosstalk 00 26 22   41 Hello  0 Thank you very much  Norah  2 Thank you very much  Mayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support  Problem is they're all billionaires  If you look   On the other hand  of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally  Mr  Bloomberg  I beat Trump 47 of those 50 times  If you look at battleground States like Michigan  Wisconsin  and Pennsylvania  polling just done  32 I beat Trump  And if you want to be Trump  what you're going to need is an unprecedented  grassroots movement of black and white and Latino  Native American and Asian people that was standing up and fighting for justice  16 That's what our movement is about  2 Absolutely  1 You know  Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements  No  no  no  no  no  Joe voted for the war in Iraq  My point was   not to be   I have cast thousands of votes  including bad votes  That was a bad vote  I have today a D minus voting record from the NRA  30 years ago  I likely lost a race for the one seat for Congress in Vermont because 30 years ago I supported a ban on assault weapons  41 30 years ago  Right now my view is we need to expand background checks and the gun show loophole and do what the American people want  not what the NRA wants  13 30 years ago  supported a ban on assault weapons  Mike Bloomberg has thought it a very good organization  Moms Demand Action  congratulations  They have credit me with gun sense  as you  13   Furthermore  furthermore  it is my view that the time is now  and Joe made this point  Look  at the end of the day  we need to rally the America people  Here is the good news  Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings  the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety  not be dictated to by the NRA  And I am proud that I have a D minus voting record from the NRA  If elected president  it will get worse than that  34 Our campaign is about changing American priorities  Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires  we're going to have high quality universal childcare for every family in this country  because the psychologists tell us zero to four are the most important years of human development  We are going to triple funding for low income Title One schools  because kids' education should not depend upon the zip code in which they live  We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition free through a tax on Wall Street speculation  and we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than  60 000 a year  We want great teachers  49 Very proud working with  3 Very proud  very proud working with Congressman Jim Clyburn  South Carolina  that we increased funding for the Community Health Center program by  11 billion  as part of the Affordable Care Act  which now provides for 9 million Americans access to primary health care  dental care  mental health counseling  and low cost prescription drugs  In that bill  we also put  2 billion into a program  which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors  nurses  dentists  We have a major dental affordable crisis in this country  to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas  The advantage of a Medicare For All healthcare program  because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies  we will have healthcare for all people in all parts of this country  53 All right  Vice President Biden  please  Vice President Biden  4 Can I respond to that  0 All right  look  you're right  We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken  it is racist  got more people in jail than any other country on earth  including China  And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs  So I do believe that on day one  we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act  which if you can believe it  now equates heroin with marijuana  That's insane  We're going to take marijuana out of that  and effectively legalized marijuana in every state in the country  What we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people arrested for possession of marijuana  And I'll tell you what else we're going to do  we're going to provide help to the African American  Latino  Native American community to start businesses  to sell legal marijuana  rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market  56 In the White House today  we have a self described  great genius   Self described  And this great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months  April is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined  I wish I was kidding  That is what he said  What do we have to do  Whether or not the issue is climate change  which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation  or infectious diseases like coronavirus  requiring international cooperation  we have to work and expand the World Health Organization  Obviously we have to make sure the CDC  the NIH  our infectious departments are fully funded  This is a global problem  55 We've got to work with countries  1  NAME  1 Can I say one word  3 I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world  and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago  He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the Politburo  But who the hell is the Politburo responsive to  Who elects the Politburo  You got a real dictatorship there  Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba  What I said is what Barack Obama said  in terms of Cuba  that Cuba made progress on education  Yes  I think  29 Really  Really  3 Literacy programs are bad  What Barack Obama said is  2  they made great progress on education and healthcare  That was Barack Obama  Occasionally  6 Excuse me  Occasionally  it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy  and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world  in Chile  in Guatemala  in Iran  And when dictatorships  whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans  do something good  22  NAME  1 But you don't have to trade love letters with them  4 That is untrue  categorically untrue  2 I have condemned authoritarianism  whether it is the people in Saudi Arabia  that the United States government has loved for years  6 Cuba  Nicaragua  authoritarianism of any stripe is bad  5 That is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good  4 Look at what Barack Obama said about international  crosstalk 00 16 30   2 Let us be clear  Do we think healthcare for all  Pete  is some kind of radical communist idea  10 Do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage  1 Do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing  4 Do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea  3 Do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea  3 The truth is  0 Pete  the American people support my agenda  that is why I am beating Trump in virtually every poll  and is why I will defeat him  9 Amy used the word alienating  Hey Amy  my favorability nationally  I believe are the highest up here  as a matter of fact  But the point is  the way we are going to beat Trump  which is what everybody up here wants  is we need a campaign of energy and excitement  We need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States  We need to bring working people back into the democratic party  We need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before  That is what our campaign is about  35 Let me just  the answer is  it's something that we would take into consideration  But here is the point  I am very proud of being Jewish  I actually lived in Israel for some months  but what I happen to believe is that right now  sadly  tragically  in Israel  through Bibi Netanyahu  you have a reactionary racist who is now running that country  And I happen to believe  I happen to believe  that what our foreign policy in the mid east should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of Israel  But you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people  We have got to have a policy that reaches out to the Palestinians  and the Americans  And in answer to your question  that will come within the context of bringing nations together in the mid east  57 Can I respond  0 Can I respond to that  3 Misconception  1 Misconception  and you're hearing it here tonight  is that the ideas I'm talking about are radical  They're not  In one form or another  they exist in countries all over the world  Healthcare is a human right  We have the necessity  the moral imperative to address the existential threat of climate change  Other countries are doing that  We don't need more people in jail  disproportionately African American  than any other country on earth  Not a radical idea  The motto  the saying that that moves me the most is from Nelson Mandela and Mandela said   Everything is impossible until it happens   And that means  if we have the guts to stand up to powerful special interest  we're doing phenomenally well  If we can bring working people together  black and white and Latino  we can create a nation  59 Where all people have a good standard of living  2 In order to beat Donald Trump  we're going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States  Mr  Bloomberg had policies in New York city of stop and frisk  which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way  That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout  What our movement is about is bringing working class people together  black and white and Latino  Native American  Asian American  around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class  And that agenda says that maybe  just maybe  we should join the rest of the industrialized world  guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right  raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour  And have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry  because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change  Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump  70 If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long neglected working class is polarizing  I think you got the wrong word  What we are trying finally to do  is to give a voice to people who have to 45 years of work are not making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago  We are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick of tired of billionaires like Mr  Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth  while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight  And that's what we are saying  Pete  is maybe it's a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington rather than your billionaire campaign contributors  46 Including 46 billionaires  2 We are more union support than you have ever dreamed of  4 We have the support of unions all across this country  3 Really  0 We have over 10 6 million people on Twitter and 99 9  of them are decent human beings  are working people  are people who believe in justice  compassion and love  And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks  who attack trade union leaders  I disowned those people  they are not part of our movement  But let me also say  what I hope my friends up here will agree with  is that if you look at the wild West of the internet  talk to some of the African American women on my campaign  talk to Senator Nina Turner  talk to others and find the vicious racist  sexist attacks that are coming their way as well  So I would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet  Our campaign is about issues  It's about fighting for the working families and the middle class  It is not about vicious attacks on other people  70 Well thank you  1 I don't think it is especially the case by the way  2 Pete if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign  what you will see is the most ugly  sexist  racist attacks that are  I won't even describe them here  they're so disgusting  And let me say something else about this  not being too paranoid  All of us remember 2016 and what we remember his efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up  I'm not saying that's happening  but it would not shock me  I saw some of those tweets regarding the Culinary Workers Union  I have a 30 year  100  pro union voting record  Do you think I would support or anybody supports me  would be attacking union leaders  It's not thinkable  42 No  Let me be very clear  two points  For a hundred years  from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama  this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for people  And yet today  despite spending twice as much per capita  Chuck  twice as much as any other major country on earth  we got 87 million who are uninsured or under insured  We got over 60 000 people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time  We're getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry  which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing  500 000 people go bankrupt every year because they can't afford medical bills  So let me be very clear  to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union  a great union  I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have  We will only expand it  for them  for every union in America and for the working class of this country  69 She name checked me second  4  inaudible 00 20 24   2 I am also a top  0 It's my turn  yeah  2 Okay  Somehow or another  Canada can provide universal health care to all their people at half the cost  UK can do it  France can do  Germany did  All  11   half the cost  UK can do it  France can do it  Germany could  All of Europe can do it  Gee whiz  Somehow or another  we are the only major country on earth that can't do it  Why is that  And I'll tell you why  It's because last year the healthcare industry made  100 billion in profits  Pharmaceutical industry  top six companies   69 billion in profit  And those CEOs are contributing to Pete's campaign and other campaigns  Up here  31 Maybe it is finally time that we said as a nation   Enough is enough  The function of a rational healthcare system is not to make the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies rich  It is to provide healthcare to all people as a human right  not a privilege   No premiums  20 No copayments  No deductibles  2 And your plan costs  50 trillion  1 Let's be clear  I'm sorry  Who did you call on  2 Can I respond here  3 I think we did  Let me tell you what happened  First of all  you're right and thank you Las Vegas for the excellent medical care I got in the hospital two days  And I think the one area  maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I share  you have stents as well  16 Well  we both have two stents  It's a procedure that is done about a million times a year  So we released the full report of that heart attack  Second of all  we released the full  my whole 29 years in the Capitol  the attending physician  all of my history  medical history  And furthermore  we released reports from two leading Vermont cardiologist who described my situation  And by the way  who said   Bernie Sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the United States   Hey  follow me around the campaign trail  Three  four  five events a day  See how you're doing compared to me  43 Thank you  1 Let's level  Let's level  Pete  Under your plan  which is a maintenance continuation of the status quo  7 Can I finish  The average American today is paying  12 000 a year  That's what that family is paying  20  of a 60 000 income   12 000 a year  Highest prices in the world for prescription drugs  Just the other day  a major study came out from Yale  epidemiologists in Lancet  one of the leading medical publications in the world  What they said  my friends  is Medicare for all will save  450 billion a year because we are eliminated the absurdity of thousands of separate plans that required hundreds of billions of dollars of administration  And by the way  ending the hundred billion a year in profiteering for the drug companies and the insurance companies  45 Your plan  by the way  crosstalk 00 37 31  costs  2 You know  we talk about electability and everybody up here wants to beat Trump  And we talked about stop and frisk and  inaudible 00 45 32  has established and the problems there  but maybe we should also ask how Mayor Bloomberg in 2004 supported George W  Bush for president  Put money into Republican candidates for the United States Senate  when some of us  Joe and I and others were fighting for Democrats to control the United States Senate  26 Maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut social security  Medicare and Medicaid  If that's a way to beat Donald Trump  wow  I would be very surprised  14 Si  2 What I tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us  that if we don't act incredibly boldly within the next six  seven years  there will be irreparable damage done  not just in Nevada  not just to Vermont or Massachusetts  but to the entire world  Joe said it right  this is an existential threat  You know what that means  Chuck  That means we're fighting for the future of this planet  And the Green New Deal that I support  by the way  will create up to 20 million good paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy  This is a moral issue  my friends  We have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable  That is more important than the profits of the fossil fuel industry  66 All right  When we talk about a corrupt political system bought by billionaires like Mr  Bloomberg  it manifests itself in a tax code in which not only is Amazon and many other major corporations  some owned by the wealthiest people in this country  not paying a nickel in taxes  we have the insane situation that billionaires today  if you can believe it  have an effective tax rate lower than the middle class  So maybe just  32 You did  you and your campaign contributions  5 Not me  You and your campaign contributions are electing people to represent the wealthy and the powerful  6 Well  and Republicans too  and George W  Bush as well  4 I'll tell you what I mean  We have a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth income  Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans  That's wrong  That's immoral  That should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets  where we have kids who cannot afford to go to college  when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt  We have enormous problems facing this country and we cannot continue seeing a situation where in the last three years  billionaires in this country saw an  850 billion increase in their wealth  Congratulations  Mr  Bloomberg  But the average American last year saw less than a 1  increase in his or her income  That's wrong  53 That's me  right  1 Thank you  It is my policy and I'm very proud of that policy  What we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is make sure that those people who are working  you know what Mr  Bloomberg  It wasn't you who made all that money  Maybe your workers played some role in that as well  And it is important that those workers are able to share the benefits also  When we have so many people go to work every day and they feel not good about their jobs  they feel like cogs in a machine  I want workers to be able to sit on corporate boards as well  so they can have some say of what happens to their lives  41 What was the result of that poll  Who was winning  6 Well  the question was that I was winning and I think by a fairly comfortable margin  You might mention that  But here is the point  Let's talk about democratic socialism  not communism Mr  Bloomberg  that's a cheap shot  Let's talk about democratic  Let's talk about what goes on in countries like Denmark  where Pete correctly pointed out  they have a much higher quality of life in many respects than we do  What are we talking about  21 We are living in many ways in a socialist society right now  Problem is  as Dr  Martin Luther King reminded us  we have socialism for the very rich  rugged individualism for the poor  14 Let me finish  When Donald Trump gets  800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums  that's socialism for the rich  Walmart  we have to subsidize Walmart's workers who are on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages  that's socialism for the rich  I believe in democratic socialism for working people  not billionaires  health care for all  and educational opportunities for all  38 Creating a government to works  crosstalk 00 16 44  for all  not just Mr  Bloomberg  0 Well  you missed that I work in Washington  house one  2 Live in Burlington  house two  2 And like thousands of other Vermonters  I do have a summer camp  Forgive me for that  Where is your home  Which tax  6  inaudible 00 17 00  cap  forgive me for that  Where is your home  Which tax haven do you have your home  2 Thank you  0 But you're not being honest  the premiums would be eliminated  3 I'm saving people money because they don't pay any premiums  out of pocket expenses  co payments or deductibles  They're going to be much better off  7 Well  we've got it all up there on the internet  It's a payroll tax  4 Because we have a wealth tax  Elizabeth has a good one  Our is a little bit tougher on Mr  Bloomberg than hurts  We're going to raise it in a progressive way  which deals with income and wealth inequality and make certain finally that healthcare in this country is a human right  not a privilege  16 Well the process includes 500 super delegates on the second ballot  so I think that  5   that the will of the people should prevail  2 Yes  1   who has the most votes should become the nominee  1 Just continue  inaudible 00 46 39   2 Unfortunately Rulac  among other groups  Latino groups  saw that bill having provisions akin to slavery Joe  But the bottom line is all of us are united in defeating the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country  That we agree on  17 But where we don't agree  I think  is why we are today the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people  Why three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America  when 500 000 people sleep out on the street  Why hundreds of thousands of bright young kids can't afford to go to college and 45 million remain in student debt  24 Bottom line here  real change never takes place from the top on down  never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires  We need to mobilize millions of people to stand up for justice  That's our campaign  Join us at berniesanders com  Thank you  19 Because Donald Trump lies all the time  It doesn't matter what Donald Trump says  it's a sad state of affairs  it really is  He will say terrible things about Joe  he has  inaudible 00 02 32  ugly  disgusting things about Elizabeth  about Amy  about anybody else who was up here  But I think George  that at the end of the day  the way we defeat Donald Trump and everybody up here by the way  is united  No matter who wins this damn thing  we're all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump  41 I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country  And that is appealing to working class people  who have given up on the political process because they don't believe that anybody is hearing their pain  perceiving that pain  feeling their pain  And we got to bring young people into the political process  I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6 000 votes  What was most significant  most significant  is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30   If we do that nationally  we're going to defeat Donald Trump  39 That's true  And that's the disappointment and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters  But if there is a good spot  a good aspect about that campaign  is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama's historic 2008 campaign  And if that happens nationally  we're going to win and defeat Trump  23 I'm not  1 Needless to say  I've never said that  but let me tell you what I do say  The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country  not for the billionaire class  The way you bring people together  Republicans  independents  Democrats  progressives  conservatives  you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour  The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we're not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations  they're going to start paying their fair share of taxes  That's what the American people want  And I'll tell you something else  the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right  And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry they're not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire  That's how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump  74 Well  for a start  what the studies show  if we do what Joe wants  we'll be spending some  50 trillion on healthcare over the next 10 years  That's the status quo  Joe  That's what Health and Human Services says   crosstalk 00 15 15  And what we have got to do Joe  and what we have got to do is understand  simple question  Joe  we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made  100 billion in profit  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting  500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans  What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money  Substantial  be much less expensive than your plan  And we will expand Medicare to include dental care  eyeglasses  hearing aides and home health care as well  67 70 is the new 50  0 George  George  can I  0 Look  at the end of the day  we got to ask ourselves a very simple question  whether it's healthcare in fact  or anything else  Why are we the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people  Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs  Have 87 million people uninsured or under insured  30 000 die because they don't get to a doctor on time  and 500 000 people going bankrupt  for what reason  Because they have cancer or heart disease  or Alzheimer's  We got to ask that question  why is it why  Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years  and here is the answer  If you want real change in healthcare  at the end of the day  you're going to have to take on the insurance companies  and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all  not huge profits for the insurance companies  You're going to have to take on the drug companies  and their corruption  and their price fixing  and tell them   Sorry  we're not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs  than do the people of other country   But at the end of the day  there's no way around it  You may want to nibble around the edges  but ultimately  you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies  to tell Wall Street  to tell the insurance companies  to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us  not a handful of special interests  87 Along with Elizabeth and Amy  we sat for two weeks listening to the impeachment process  and here's what I think the horror and the danger of what happened was not only the acquittal of Trump  who in fact committed impeachable offenses  and obstructed Congress  It is the precedent that it set  The precedent that it set  And what that precedent is about now is in the future  you're going to have presidents who say   Hey  governor  you want highway money  You better support me  or you're not going to get it   Because I am the president  I can do anything I want  40 Hey  Congress  you want to investigate me  Don't be ridiculous  Who cares about the Congress  Who cares about the separation of powers  Who cares about the constitution of the president  I'm the President of the United States  I have all of the power  and I'm able to intimidate members of my own party  The saddest aspect of this whole thing  is you have Republicans in the Senate who knew better  They knew that Donald Trump is a crook  They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat  but they didn't have the guts  with the exception of Romney to vote against him  That is a sad day  34 I wasn't able to hear that question  1 I thought it was Sanders Klobuchar  3 I must confess  I don't get too many newspaper editorial support  Must confess that  5 I did  We're very proud of that  2 But  let me just say this  I think the question started off with Secretary Clinton's critique  I think  quite honestly  as we face one of the great political crises facing America  our job is to look forward and not back to 2016  And I hope that Secretary Clinton and all of us can come together  and move in that direction  Now  second of all  in terms of Republicans  let me say  26  in that direction  Now  second of all  in terms of Republicans  let me say that in my own great state of Vermont  if my memory is correct  Amy  I got 25  of the Republican vote  And in fact  there were periods when I was in the House of Representatives  a number of years where I passed more amendments on the floor of the House in a bipartisan way than any other member of the House and that is when you bring people together on an issue  There are many conservative Republicans  for example  who are concerned about civil liberties  at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties  There are Republicans  as you know  who are concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs  There are ways that we can work with Republicans on issues where we have a common basis  54 Let's do that  0 Right  Look  here is the danger  David  there are very bad leaders all over the world  Kim Jong un in North Korea is probably responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of his people threatening all of Asia with nuclear weapons  You got Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia who is a terrible murderer  who murdered Khashoggi in cold blood and dismembered his body  You have Putin in Russia who has been involved in political assassinations of his enemies  You got Xi in China who has put a million Muslims into concentration camps  39 You cannot go around saying you're a bad guy  we're going to assassinate you  and then you're going to have  if that happens  you're opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination  What we have got to do  which Trump does not understand  is strengthen the State Department and our diplomatic capabilities  not just the military  What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say  you know what  let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN  not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives  52 Let me say this if I might  like Joe and others  I also heard the arguments in terms of the war in Iraq from Bush  from Cheney  from John Bolton  from the whole administration  I listened very carefully and I concluded that they were lying through their teeth  And I not only voted against that war  but I help lead the opposition  And it saddens me so much  If you hear what I said  it's on YouTube  my fears about all the destabilization that would take place by the US invading Iraq  It's sad to me that  that is what happened  40 But let me just pick up on a point that Tom made  which is absolutely right  Trump wants to build a wall around America  The problem is if we are going to deal with issues like climate change  not only do we in America have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry  we have to lead the entire world  This is not an American issue  It's a global issue  We got to bring China and Russia and Brazil and Pakistan and India and every major country on earth into the fight against climate change  34 And here is my dream  maybe it's a radical dream  but maybe just may be given the crisis of climate change  the world can understand that instead of spending  1 8 trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other  maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy  which is climate change  24 I can Adam  and let me also say that in 1988 I probably lost a race for Congress  and we only have one Congress person in the whole state  because in 1988 I said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country  That was 30 years ago  Furthermore  I am very proud that today I have a D  voting record from the NRA  And under my administration it will be the American people doing gun policy  not dictated by the NRA  37 But to answer your question  I come  like New Hampshire  from a very  very rural state  In Vermont until the last two years ago  we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and I represented that perspective  The world has changed  In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country  people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen  The world has changed and my views have changed  and my view is right now we need universal background checks  we end the gun show loophole  we end the so called straw man provision  We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country  and we go further  We go further  but at the bottom line is I will not be intimidated by the NRA  We're going to run the gun policy that the American people want  56 Look  you asked the simple question  is there a litmus test for those of us up here  For me there is  I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who was not 100  pro Roe v  Wade  Number two  we have got a codify Roe v  Wade into legislation  Number three  we have to significantly expand funding for Planned Parenthood  34 I don't think that's quite right  1 Let me just say  first of all  we have nine members of the Black Caucus in South Carolina supporting us  but more importantly  much of what Elizabeth said is absolutely correct  We have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare  housing  criminal justice  education  you name it  And clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with  But in terms of criminal justice  what we have got to do is understand the system is broken  is racist  We invested our young people in jobs and education  not more jails and incarceration  We end the war on drugs  which has disproportionately impacted African Americans  Latinos  and Native Americans  We end private prisons and detention centers in America  53 And  excuse me  we also  most people don't know this  Tonight in America  200 000 people are in jail without having been convicted of anything  10 200 000 people  because they can't afford the  500 for bail they need to get out of jail  That is outrageous  we're going to end cash bail in America  11 Well  I think what Senator Turner was talking about are some of the early actions of Vice President Biden  but no  Joe Biden is a friend of mine  and I'm not here to attack him  But what I would say is that what we need in terms of the African American community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education  in healthcare  There is no excuse why white families in America have 10 times more wealth than black families  No excuse that disproportionately  African Americans are in jail compared to whites  No excuse for black women dying in childbirth three times the rate that white women are doing as well  47 Let's talk about money  and let's talk about  0   I've got to answer before the question  it's more   2 I couldn't hear that  1 Well  it's a funny thing  There are millions of people who can desire to run for office  but I guess if you're work  60 billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials  you have a slight advantage  That is nonsense  What we have got to do is have a nation in which we not only overturn Citizens United  we move to public funding of election  28 In terms of money in politics  our campaign  and I am enormously proud of this  unlike some of the folks up here  I don't have 40 billionaires  Pete  contributing to my campaign  coming from the pharmaceutical industry  coming from Wall Street  and all the big money interests  What we do have is we have now over six million contributions from one and a half million people averaging  18 50 a contribution  That is unprecedented in the history of American politics  If we want to change America  you're not going to do it be electing candidates who are going out to rich people's homes begging for money  The way we're going to do it is build a mass movement of working people who are prepared to stand up  not take money from these billionaires  not take money from Wall Street  but stand up to the drug companies and Wall Street  And if you want to be part of that political revolution  berniesanders com  72 Yes  I mean  it's a disagreement  but if you look at every environmental group in this country  including the Sunrise organization  we're so proud to have their support  because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal I think ever authored by a presidential candidate  But they are saying  what the environmental groups are saying  we're simply exporting fossil fuel emissions to Mexico  There is not one word in that trade agreement   37 There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I don't know how in 2020 you can do that  Second of all  there is  in terms of outsourcing of jobs  a major crisis in this country  Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico  where workers are paid in some cases less than  2 an hour  So I think the right vote was the vote against that agreement  I don't apologize for that  33 Well  the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth  disproportionately high for the African American community  by the way  is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations  Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry  while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck  The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America  38 The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right  Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs  and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1  and by wealthy campaign contributors  Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country  What is unique about our campaign  is we say  unashamedly  we are raising our campaign contributions  not from billionaires but from working class people  That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run  It is time to take on the big money interests  It is time to change our national priorities  Thank you  63 When the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq  invade Iraq  I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster  it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region  And I'd not only voted against the wall  I help lead the effort against that wall  Just last year  I helped for the first time in the modern history of this country  pass a War Powers Act Resolution  working with a conservative Republican  Mike Lee of Utah  which said that the war in Yemen  led by Saudi Arabia was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it  46 We got a majority vote in the Senate  We got a majority vote in the House  Unfortunately  Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues  I am able to work with Republicans  I am able to bring people together  to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table  not through military efforts  23 Well  it's a little bit of a difference on that particular vote  every single member of the House  including myself voted for it  only Barbara Lee voted against it  But what I understood from right away in terms of the war in Iraq  the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country  As Joe well knows  we lost 4 500 brave troops  hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died  28 We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war  money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country  Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say  I thought they were lying  I didn't believe them for a moment  I took to the floor I did everything I could to prevent that war  Joe saw it differently  27 Okay  let me tell you  but before I tell you that  let me tell you something else  And that is  and I don't know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not  maybe they will  But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq  both of those wars were based on lies  And right now what I fear very much is we have a President who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq  40 To answer your question  what we need to do is have an international coalition  We cannot keep acting unilaterally  As you know  the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies  We have got to undo what Trump did  bring that coalition together and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon  25 Wolf  in America today  our infrastructure is crumbling  Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck  87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured  You got 500 000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight  The American people are sick and tired of endless wars  which have cost us trillions of dollars  Our job is to rebuild the United Nations  rebuild the State department  make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced  40 Other than that  you like him  2 The answer is we could do much better than a Trump led trade deal  This deal  and I think the proponents of it acknowledge  will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs  as a result of outsourcing  The heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and I'm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China  is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico  in China  elsewhere  who earn starvation wages  a dollar or  2 an hour  36 Second of all  every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it  And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet  I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very  very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world  30 The AFL CIO does  the machinists union does not  And every environmental organization in this country  including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy  opposes it  So I happen to believe  and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment  If we do not get our act together in terms of climate change  the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable  29 Well they are the same in this issue  1 Well  I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation  If this is passed  I think it will set us back a number of years  Senator Warren is right  in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table  that is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country  That is the environmental community  that  21 In Vermont and around the country  that is the environmental community  That is the workers  Bottom line here is I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations  8 Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement  in case you haven't noticed  and that is NAFTA  PNTR with China  other trade agreements were written for one reason alone  and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations  The end result of those two  just PNTR with China  Joe  and NAFTA cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom  30 I am sick and tired and will not tolerate  and we will use the power of the federal contracting system  If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else and then they think they're going to get online for a generous federal contract  they've got another thing going  We need some corporate responsibility here  and we need to protect good paying jobs in America  not see them go to China  Mexico  Vietnam  26 Well  as a matter of fact  I didn't say it  and I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this  because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want  Anybody that knows me knows that it's in comprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be President of the United States  Go to YouTube today  There's a video of me 30 years ago  talking about how a woman could become President of the United States  25 In 2015  I deferred  in fact  to Senate Warren  There was a movement to draft Senator Warren to run for President  and you know what  I stayed back  Senator Warren decided not to run  and I did run afterwards  16 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes  How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become President of the United States  Let me be very clear  If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination   I hope that's not the case  I hope it's me  But if they do  I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of our country  31 That is correct  2 Well  just to set the record straight  I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress  7 1990  That's how I won  Beat a Republican Congressman  Number two  of course   9   I don't think there's any debate on   3 I beat an incumbent Republican Congressman  4 Well  30 years ago is 1990  as a matter of fact  But I don't know that that's the major issue of the day  I think what the major issue of the day is   Does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected President  That's enough  Nobody believes that  Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes  more votes than Trump  So who believes that a woman can't win  Of course a woman can win  25 But the real question is how do we beat Trump  The only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has  by far  the largest voter turnout in the history of this country  17 I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement  4 We are endorsed by many grassroots organizations  2 Well  what I will tell you is Medicare for All  which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man  woman  and child  will cost substantially less than the status quo  Medicare for All will end the absurdity of the United States paying  by far  the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general  24 While we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30 000 people die each year  on the Medicare for All  one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4  tax on income  exempting the first  29 000  So the average family in America that today makes  60 000 would pay  1 200 a year  compared to that family paying  12 000 a year  We save money  comprehensive healthcare  because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system  42 Well  first of all  what Joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is  what you are talking about  all workers paying  on average  20  of their incomes for healthcare  that is insane  You've got 500 000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills  We're spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country  26 Look  We've talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years  Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry  of the drug companies  and finally provide healthcare to all through a Medicare for All single payer program  It won't be easy  but that is what we have to do  22 No  our plan wouldn't bankrupt the country  In fact  it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class  Let us be clear what Medicare for all does  It ends all premiums  It ends all copayments  It ends the absurdity of deductibles  It ends out of pocket expenses  It takes on the pharmaceutical industry  which  in some cases  charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here  32 What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers  because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the  500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans  26 Healthcare is a human right  Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all  The time is long overdue for us to do the same  9 We build into our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many  many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people  But here is the issue  Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago  We are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country  That is insane  In some cases  10 times more for prescription drugs  Why is that  Why is that  And the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies  And if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people healthcare as a human right  not a privilege  you know what we have to do  We are finally going to have to stand up to the healthcare industry  54 And end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering  4 Yeah  Let me just pick up on this childcare thing  Every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life  intellectually and emotionally  and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment  It is unaffordable  Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald's workers  We need to fundamentally change priorities in America  We should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal  high quality  affordable childcare  We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right  We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military  hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry  Tax breaks for billionaires  and then to tell the moms and dads in this country   We cannot have  crosstalk 01 20 36  high quality  affordable childcare   That is wrong  56 Thank you  Let's be clear  if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel  not by 2050  not by 2040  but unless we lead the world right now  not easy stuff  the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy  We are seeing Australia burning  We saw California burning  The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need  This is of course a national crisis  I've introduced legislation to indicate it's an actual crisis  We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet  That's what the Green New Deal does  That's what my legislation does and that is what we have to do  61 Nope  not at all  And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is  Donald Trump is corrupt  He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud  Now when Trump talks about socialism  what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry  Donald Trump as a businessman  received  800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing  My democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right  We're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour  We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition free  We're going to have a Green New Deal and create up to  20 million  saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren  We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company  That is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election  71 It's been a good debate  but we haven't asked the major question  The major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck  trying to get by   9   10 bucks an hour  How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92   half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight  How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all  How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional  a criminal justice system which is broken and racist  an immigration system that needs reform  This is the moment when we have got to think big  not small  This is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent  take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us  not just the one percent  Thank you  65 Well  Judy  what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar  We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country  And we have a president who is a fraud  because during his campaign he told working people one thing  and he ended up doing something else  I believe  and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months  is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country  who wants to cut social security  Medicare  and Medicaid  after he promised he would not do that  and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president  And the case to be made is  yeah  certainly  I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies  but what conservatives  I think  understand  is that we cannot have a president with that temperament  who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States  74 Judy  you're talking to somebody who  unlike some of my colleagues here  voted against NAFTA  voted against PNC  inaudible 00 11 45  with China  two agreements that cost us over four million decent paying jobs  Now  I don't agree with the  your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator  This is a modest improvement over what we have right now  It would allow  hopefully  Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions  and be able to negotiate decent contracts  But at the end of the day  in my view  it is not going to stop outsourcing  It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico  where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour  What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers  stands up for farmers  and  by the way  the word  climate change   to the best of my knowledge  is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all  which is an outrage  So no  I will not be voting for this agreement  although it makes some modest improvements  71 Look  here's the response  Trump goes around saying   The economy is doing great   Do you know what  real inflation accounted for  wages went up last year  One point one percent  That ain't great  Tonight  while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America  500 000 Americans  including 30 000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets  Today in America  we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth  more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s  We need an economy that works for working families  not just the 1 percent  That is what our campaign is about  47 Tim  in all due respect  your question misses the mark  It is not an issue of relocating people in towns  The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren  The issue  as you should know  what the scientists are telling us  is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change  You're talking about the Paris Agreement  that's fine  Ain't enough  We have got to  and I've introduced legislation to do this  declare a national emergency  The United States has got to lead the world and maybe  just maybe  instead of spending 1 8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction  maybe an American president  i e  Bernie Sanders can lead the world  Instead of spending money to kill each other  maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy  which is climate change  64 I will answer that question  but I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because I do believe this is the existential issue  7 I certainly can because people of color  in fact  are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change  And by the way  we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our African American brothers and sisters up here  to speak about an economy in which African Americans are exploited  where black women die three times at higher rates than white women  where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken  disproportionately made up of African Americans and Latinos and Native Americans who are in jail  So we need an economy that focuses on the needs of oppressed  exploited people and that is the African American community  55 Israel has  And I say this is somebody who lived in Israel as a kid  proudly Jewish  Israel has the right  not only to exist  but to exist in peace and security  But what US foreign policy must be about is not just being pro Israel  we must be pro  Palestinian as well  And whether  In my view  We must understand that right now in Israel we have leadership under Netanyahu  who has recently  as you know  been indicted for bribery  Who in my view is a racist  What we need is a level playing field in terms of the Middle East  which addresses the terrible crisis in Gaza  where 60 or 70  of the young people are unemployed  So what my foreign policy will be about is human rights  is democracy  is bringing people together in a peaceful way  trying to negotiate agreements  not endless wars with trillions of dollars of expenses  75 And I'm white as well  2 Well  I got a lot of respect for Barack Obama  I think I disagree with him on this one  Maybe a little self serving  but I do disagree  Here is the issue  The issue is where power resides in America and it's not white or black or male or female  We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy  where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians  You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s  We are the only major country on earth  not to guarantee healthcare for all people  which is why we need Medicare for all  We are facing an existential crisis of climate change  The issue is not old or young  male or female  The issue is working people standing up  taking on the billionaire class  and creating a government and an economy that works for all  not just the 1   71 I am rather proud  maybe  I don't know  The only candidate up here doesn't have any billionaire contributions  but you know what I do have  We have received more contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of the United States of America at this point in an election  averaging  18 a piece  Now there's a real competition going on up here  My good friend Joe  and he is a good friend  he's received contributions from 44 billionaires  Pete  on the other hand is trailing  Pete  you only got 39 billionaires contributing  So Pete  we look forward to you  I know you're an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you could take on Joe on that issue  But what is not a laughing matter  my friends  This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half  This is why Amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes  We need to get money out of politics  We should run our campaigns on that basis  81 Can I  1 That's right  1 I can't respond to the immigration question  1 No  This is what I would do  Day one executive order restore the legal status of 1 8 million young people in the DACA program  Day one we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers  Day one  Day one we introduce bipartisan legislation  which will  in fact  be comprehensive  which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented  That is what the people of our country want  Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up  We are going to win this election by bringing our people together  black and white and Latino  Native American  Asian American  That's what this campaign is about  That's what America must be about  64 Let's talk about how  Excuse me  let's talk about how we win an election  which is something everybody here wants to do in terms of defeating the most dangerous president in American history  So let me tell you how you're win it  You have the largest voter turnout in the history of America  And you don't have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement  And you know  create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America  We need a progressive agenda  Medicare for all  raising the minimum wage to a living wage  leading the world in combating climate change  making public colleges and universities  52 available to all because we have free tuition or intensely Oh student debt in this country  6 I believe in the concept of universality and one of the crises in America today is people are sick and tired of filling out forms  So you're not eligible for the program today because you're at 150 but you'll lost your job by eligible  You've got a better job  you're eligible  I think what we have to do is what we do with social security  what we do with public education  Donald Trump's kids can go to a public school  they should be able to go to a public school  What we all need right now is a revolution in education  We have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality  affordable childcare  We need to make public colleges and universities tuition free  And by taxing billionaires and by taxing wall street  we will cancel all student debt in this country  61 We need moral leadership in the white house  We need a president who will do everything humanly possible to end all forms of discrimination against the transgender community  against the African American community  against the Latino community  and against all minorities in this country  But above and beyond providing the moral leadership of trying to bring our people together  What we also need for the transgender community is to make sure that health care is available to every person in this country  regardless of their sexual orientation or their needs  And that is why I strongly support and have helped lead the effort for a Medicare for all single payer program  which will provide comprehensive healthcare to all people  including certainly the transgender community  67 In all due respect to Joe  Joe  you're also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq  What we need to do  is I think  rethink and the Washington post piece was very educational  What we need to rethink  is the entire war on terror  We have lost thousands of our own men and women  brave soldiers  Hundreds of thousands  if not millions of people  have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries  It is time right now  that we bring this world together  to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes  which are causing these wars  50 Well  only one person  my good friend Barbara Lee was right on that issue  She was the only person in the house to vote against the war in Afghanistan  She was right  I was wrong  So was everybody else in the house  But to answer your question  I don't think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 3 00 AM in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the Kurds  I think you work with the international community  you remove all troops over a period of time  a short period of time within one year  36 Well Tim  at a time when we're spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation  When 87 million people are uninsured or under insured  When 30 000 people are dying each year because they don't get to a doctor when they should and what a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have  You know what  I think we will pass a Medicare for all  single payer system  28 And I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office  Now to answer your question  I think when we go out to the American people and tell them  that right now  we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry  for example  Which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as it's charged in this country  Where the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care  dental care  eyeglasses  and hearing AIDS and does it at a cost far  far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about  You know what  We're going to have the American people behind us  We will have Congress behind it  50 Just Waving to you Joe  3 Under Joe's plan essentially  we retain the status quo  4 That is exactly true  Thank you  And by the way  Joe  under your plan  you asked me how are we going to pay for it  Under your plan I'll tell you how we're paying for right now  The average worker in America  their family makes 60 000 a year  That family is now paying  12 000 a year for health care  20  of the income or the Medicare for all that family will be paying  1 200 a year because we're eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending  there's Byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans  46 That's right  We all got to increase personal taxes  but we're eliminating premiums  we're eliminating copayments  we're eliminating deductibles  we're eliminating all out of pocket expenses and no family in America will spend more than  200 a year on prescription drugs   crosstalk 00 09 41  26 It's first time I did this  1 She took my name in vain  She hurt my feelings   crosstalk 01 01 09  9 All right  My fight  Amy  it's not with the governor of Kentucky  My fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry  With the greed and corruption of the insurance industry  These guys last year made  100 billion in profit and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight  The day has got to come and Joe is not talking about it  Amy is not talking about it  The day has got to come and I will bring that day about what we finally say that the drug companies and the insurance companies  the function of health care is that provided for all of our people in a cost effective way  not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies   crosstalk 01 02 06  56 Well  I can give out any one of four books that I wrote  But I think the gift that all of us need to give to the American people is a very different vision of the reality of the Trump administration  And the vision that we need to bring forth  is to create a government and a nation based on love and compassion  not greed and hatred  We need a vision which says that in our great country  all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living  have health care  have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income  So we need a new vision  which brings our people together  Around an agenda that works for all  not the Trump vision of dividing us up to benefit the billionaire class  That's my vision  68 45 years  Americans have been listening to great speeches  and at the end of the day  the average American worker is not making a nickel more than he or she did in real wages  over those 45 years  The truth is that real change always takes place  Real change always takes place from the bottom on up  never from the top on down  And that is why in this campaign  I am so proud that we have over a million volunteers  We have some of the strongest grassroots organizations  We have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in American history  Please join the political revolution  berniesanders com  Let's defeat Trump  Let's transform this country  Thank you  59 Well  Rachel  sadly  we have a president who is not only a pathological liar  he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America  But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump  because if we are  you know what  We're going to lose the election  Right now  you've got 87 million people who have no health insurance  or under insured  We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change  You got 500 000 people sleeping out on the street  and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing  What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time  In other words  we can deal with Trump's corruption  but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country  We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt  dominated by a handful of billionaires  and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America  We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice  73 Thank you  I wrote the damn bill  1 No  he's right  We don't have to tear down the system  but we do have to do what the American people want  And the American people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel  it is dysfunctional  Now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country  and yet we got 87 million uninsured  underinsured  in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada  or other countries  500  000 people go bankrupt because of medically related issues  they come down with cancer  and that's a reason to go bankrupt  47 Now  some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry  We should not take on the pharmaceutical industry  But you know what  If you think back to FDR  and if you think to JFK  and Harry Truman  and Barack Obama  as a matter of fact  people have been talking about healthcare for all  Well  you know what  I think now is the time  And in the first week of my administration  we will introduce Medicare for all  Medicare for all  that means no deductibles  no copayments  no out of pocket expenses  That's where we got to go  36 Well  I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law  And what the American people are saying   Nobody is above the law  and I think what the American people are also saying is in fact  that if this president did break the law  he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law  But at the end of the day  what we need to do is to bring our people together  not just in opposition to Trump  The initial question I think that you wrote  that somebody raised him was that we are a divided nation  You know what  I kind of reject that  I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country  majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage  When you talk about the climate crisis  the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real  They know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry  71 They know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel  energy efficiency and sustainable energy  Even on issues like guns  the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence  So I believe  yep  we've got to deal with Trump  but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn't just go to the people on top  but to all us  26 Well  I think Joe is right  I think that is the function of the attorney general  but what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe  and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television  they do believe that we have a president who thinks he's above the law  We have a president who is engaged in corruption  We have a president who was obstructed justice  and in my view  somebody was a violated the emoluments clause  I think Joe is right  That is the function of an independent department of justice  but my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law  39 Tom  you stated  you were talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency  I've introduced legislation to just do that  Now  I disagree with the thrust of the original question  Because your question has said   What are we going to do in decades   We don't have decades  What the scientists are telling us  we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years  We're talking about cities all over the world  major cities going on the water  We're talking about increased drought  talking about increased extreme weather disturbances  36 The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come  they're going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world  What we have got to do tonight and I will do as president  is to tell the fossil fuel industry that they're short term profits on not more important than the future of this planet  And by the way  the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that they are carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe we should think about prosecuting them as well  44 Other than that  you like him  1 Well  let me just say this  One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it  And not only that  I voted against the very first Gulf War as well  And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are  that we don't have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined  But to answer your question  yeah  I think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region  it is time to bring our troops home  54 But unlike Trump  I will not do it through a tweet at three o'clock in the morning  I will do it working with the international community and if it's necessary to negotiate with the Taliban  of course  we will do that  But at the end of the day we have to rethink the entire war on terror  which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives  not only for our own men and women in the armed forces  but for people in that region as well  27 I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi  but this is a brutal dictatorship which gets every taken can to crush democracy  treats women as third class citizens  And when we rethink our American foreign policy  what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally  We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say   We are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts   40 And by the way  the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians  It is no longer good enough for us to simply to be pro Israel  I am pro Israel  but we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve  What is going on in Gaza right now  where youth unemployment is 70 or 80  is unsustainable  We need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world  work with United nations and not continue to support brutal dictatorships  33  crosstalk 01 42 32  mentioned that women feel troubling on it  Well  let me just tell you that if there's ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women  this is the moment  I get very tired  very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say   Get the government off our backs  We want small government   Well  if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people  then understand that it is women who control their own bodies  not politicians  36  crosstalk 01 51 09  right to the point  The American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt and it is not just voter suppression  which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state  not just denying black people and people of color  the right to vote  but we also have a system through Citizens United  which allows a billionaires to buy elections  What we need to do  simple and straight forward  in every state in this country through the federal government  if you are 18 you have a right to vote  end of discussion  We have to overturn Citizens United  We need to move toward public funding of elections  48 Thank you  Let me say a word about myself  unusual as it may seem  I am the son of an immigrant  young man of 17  who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket  I have some sense of the immigrant experience  I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country  At the age of 21  as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago  I was arrested  spent the night in jail  and I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination  racial discrimination  sexism  homophobia  xenophobia  and religious bigotry  I will lead an administration that will look like America  will end the divisiveness brought by Trump and bring us together  During this campaign  I am proud to say that I have received more campaign contributions than any candidate at this point in an election in American history  over four million contributions averaging  18 a piece  If you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump  but transform America  that doesn't have a super PAC  doesn't do fundraisers at wealthy people's home  please join us at berniesanders com  Thank you  93 No they don't  In my judgment  Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country  It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report  I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause  This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous  And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident  the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension  So I look forward  by the way  not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process  but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate  55 Let me make a point  I think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment  I hope that he is impeached  But I think what would be a disaster if the American people believed that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under insured  We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change  We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck  So what we have got to do is end this corruption set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way  But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country  46 As somebody who wrote the damn bill as I said  Let's be clear on the Medicare for All bill that I wrote  premiums are gone  co payments are gone  deductibles are gone  All out of pocket expenses are gone  We're going to do better than the Canadian's doing  that is what they have managed to do  At the end of the day  the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills  But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up  They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody  the tax increase they pay will be substantially less  substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expenses  52 I get a little bit tired  I must say  of people defending a system which is dysfunctional  which is cruel  87 million uninsured  30 000 people dying every single year  500 000 people going bankrupt  For what reason  they came down with cancer  I will tell you what the issue is here  The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry  which made  100 billion in profit  Whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price fixing pharmaceutical industry  which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs  And if we don't have the guts to do that  if all we could do is take their money  we should be ashamed of ourselves  47 Damn right  we will  and I'll tell you why  If you look up what goes on in America today  we have an infrastructure which is collapsing  We can put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads  our bridges  our water systems  our wastewater plants  airports  et cetera  Furthermore  and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight  this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change  and the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy  We need workers to do childcare  We need workers  great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now  We need more doctors  we need more dentists  we need more carpenters  we need more sheet metal metalworkers  When we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt  we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs  66 When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today  when you have 87 million people uninsured or under insured  when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt  and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society  that is a moral and economic outrage  The truth is  we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years  If you are asking me  do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying  the wealthiest  top one tenth of 1   start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us  Yes  that's exactly what I believe  71 Erin  Erin  Erin  1 I'm sorry  say that again  0 No  Turkey is not a U S  ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter  The crisis here  as I think Joe said and Pete said  is when you begin to betray people   And in terms of the Kurds  11 000 of them died fighting ISIS  20 000 were wounded  And the United States said   We are with you  We're standing with you   And then suddenly one day  after a phone call with Erdogan  announced by tweet  Trump reverses that policy  Now you tell me  what country in the world will trust the word of the President of the United States  In other words  what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy  to do military policy because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar  60 Are you suggesting I'm Vladimir Putin  0 I know  5 I'm healthy  I'm feeling great  But I would like to respond to that question  3 Thank you  1 I'm not on it tonight   crosstalk 01 52 17   0 I'm more than happy to answer your question  but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said  Let's take a deep breath  take a look at this opioid epidemic  You have the executive CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year  and in this particular case with the opioids  they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them  Last year  the top 10 drug companies made  69 billion in profit  This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country  and it's not just the drug companies  Right now  the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world  and they continue to make huge profits  58 That is why we need a political revolution  3   that says enough is enough to this behavior  5 Well  let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens  New York  berniesanders com  We're going to have a special guest at that event and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country  That is how I think I can reassure the American people  But let me take this moment  if I might  to thank so many people from all over this country  including many of my colleagues up here  for their love  for their prayers  for their well wishes  I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart  and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening  44 When we talk about a rigged economy it's not just the grotesque level of income in wealth and equality  It is also the fact that in sector after sector  whether it is Wall Street where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States  whether it is media where you have 10 media companies that control about 90  of what the American people see  hear or read  whether it is agribusiness where we see merger after merger  which is resulting in the decline of family based farming in this country  we need a president who has the guts to appoint an Attorney General who will take on these huge monopolies  protect small business  and protect consumers by ending the price fixing which we see every day  52 Two things  Let me respond  0   in two ways  Joe you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done  But you know what you also got done  I say this as a good friend  You got the disastrous war in Iraq done  You got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle class families all over this country  You got trade agreements  like NAFTA and PNTR  with China done which have cost us four million jobs  23 Now let's get to Medicare for all  Let's be honest  We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth  The answer is if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic have that guts  to stand up to the drug companies  and the insurance companies  and tell them that the function of healthcare is the guaranteed care to all people  Not to make 100 billion dollars in profit  30 If we stood together we could create the greatest healthcare system in the world  2 No you can't  0 You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the  3   healthcare industry  0 I'll tell you why  0  crosstalk 02 37 26  Here's the radical reason why  it's what the American people want  5 All right  The American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires  They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes  Poll came out yesterday  71  of Democrats support Medicare for all  The people of this country understand that we got to make public colleges and universities tuition free  More and more Americans  including Republicans  understand we need bold action if we're going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren  The way you win an election  in this time in history  is not the same old same old  You have to inspire people  you have to excite people  You got to bring working people  and young people  and poor people into  45   the political process  0 Because they know you stand for them not corporate America  3 When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on veterans affairs  I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history and I failed  I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate  so we had to go back to the drawing board  And I worked with John McCain and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted  but it turned out that we were able to pass a very  very significant piece of legislation  including  5 billion more for the veterans administration  More recently  I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah  mike Lee  And Mike understood  although he and I disagree on everything  that the US involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen  And for the first time in 45 years  we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get the votes to get the US troops out of that area  70 But I think at the end of the day what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people  the divisiveness  trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion  and there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man  woman  and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1   A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country  45 We are in a struggle for the future of this country  5 Let me be blunt and tell you what you don't hear much about in Congress  or in the media  and that is it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump  the most dangerous president in the history of this country  We must do more  We must do more  We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society  where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country  As president  I am prepared to take them on  Yes  we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage  Yes  we will finally make sure that every American has healthcare as a human right  not a privilege  Yes  we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change  and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel  74 Joe said that Medicare for all would cost over  30 trillion  That's right  Joe  Status quo over 10 years will be  50 trillion  Every study done shows that Medicare for all is the most cost effective approach to providing healthcare to every man  woman  and child in this country  I  who wrote the damn bill  if I may say so  intend to eliminate all out of pocket expenses  All deductibles  All copayments  Nobody in America will pay more than  200 a year for prescription drugs  because we're going to stand up to the greed  and corruption  and price fixing of the pharmaceutical industry  We need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does  not a system which provides  100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies  To tell you how absurd the system is  tonight on ABC  the healthcare industry will be advertising  telling you how bad Medicare for all is  because they want to protect their profits  That is absurd  88 Let us be clear  Joe  In the United States of America  we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians  or any other major country on earth  12 Yeah  but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries  and they guarantee health care to all people  Under my Medicare for all proposal  when you don't pay out of pocket  and you don't pay premiums  Maybe you have run into people who love their premiums  I haven't  What people want is cost effective health care  Medicare for all will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill  31 George  you talked about  was it 150 million people on private insurance  50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs  or they go unemployed  or their employer changes their insurance policy  Medicare for All is comprehensive healthcare  covers all basic needs  including home healthcare  It allows you to go to any doctor you want  which many private insurance company programs do not  So if you want comprehensive healthcare  freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital  no more than 200 dollars a year for prescription drugs  taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies  moving to Medicare for All is a way to go  52 As a matter of fact they will with our bill  1 One minute  George  3 All right  Two points  You got to defend the fact that today  not only do we 87 million people uninsured and underinsured  you got to defend the fact that 500000 Americans are going bankrupt  You know why they're going bankrupt  Because they suffered a terrible disease  Cancer or heart disease  Under my legislation people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer  and our program is the only one that does that  36 No  but what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation  the gun legislation the people here are talking about  Medicare for all  climate change legislation that saves the planet  I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen  And you could do it in a variety of ways  You could do that through budget reconciliation law  You have a vice president who will in fact tell the senate what is appropriate and what is not  what is an order and what is not  33 But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that in fact  in terms of gun issues  picking up on Corey and Beto and everybody else  what we are looking at is a corrupt political system  And that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or in this case you got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership  I am proud that year after year I had an F rating from the NRA and as president  I will not be intimidated by the NRA  46 There is a reason why in the last 45 years  the average American today  despite an explosion of technology and work or productivity  is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago  And one of the reasons is that for decades we have had disastrous trade policies  24 And I got to say to my good friend Joe Biden  Joe and I strongly disagree on trade  I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR  which cost this country over four million good paying jobs  And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50  of what they made in manufacturing  30 So Trump obviously hasn't a clue  Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at three o'clock in the morning  What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers  represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere  We're losing billions right now because of Trump's policy  A trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad and then thinks they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract  under Bernie Sanders  they got another guess coming  43 David  let me answer that  but let me just comment on something that the vice president said  You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge  The truth is  the big mistake  the huge mistake  and one of the big differences between you and me  I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq  19 I voted against the war in Iraq and helped lead the opposition  And it's sad to say  I mean  I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war  16 As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs  I want to pick up on what Pete said  we cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us  who have responded to the call of duty  But I think also  I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump's military budgets  I don't think we have to spend  750 billion a year on the military when we don't even know who our enemy is  38 I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together  bring it together on climate change  bring it together in fighting against terrorism  and make it clear that we  as a planet  as a global community  we'll work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies  and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism  But dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it  35 Well  first of all  let me be very clear  Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant  What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future  19 In terms of democratic socialism  to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe  is extremely unfair  I'll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism  I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia  guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right  I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave  I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage  and that we expand the trade union movement  36 I happen to believe also that what  to me  democratic socialism means  is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough  Jorge  not in the media  and not in Congress  You got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country  You got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street  the insurance companies  and in the media  Maybe  just  inaudible 00 27 49  maybe  what we should be doing  29   is creating an economy that works for all of us  not 1   That's my understanding of democratic socialism  7 Guess what  You're guessing  All right  here's the answer  We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world  Yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth  We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can't work two or three jobs to support themselves  which is why under my legislation we'll move to see that every teacher in America makes at least  60 000 a year  39 What we will also do is not only have universal pre K  we will make public colleges  and universities  and HBCUs debt free  What we will also do  because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need  we are going to cancel all student debt in this country  31 We are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation  9 I'd say that resilience to me means growing up in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn  New York  the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket  Professional resilience means to me  George  running for US Senate in Vermont and getting one percent of the vote  running for governor and getting two percent of the vote  Finally  becoming mayor of Burlington  Vermont with ten vote margin  30 What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career  I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country  whether it is Wall Street  whether it is the insurance industry  whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today  whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex  I feel confident that given a lifelong record I've taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country  that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that works for all of us  Not just the one percent  61 Tonight  in America as we speak  87 million Americans are uninsured or under insured  but the healthcare industry made a  100 billion in profits last year  Tonight  as we speak right now  500 000 Americans are sleeping out on the street  and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits  did not pay one nickel in federal income tax  30 Tonight  half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck  and yet 49  of all new income goes to the top 1   Tonight  the fossil fuel industry continues to receive 100s of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet  25 We have got to take on Trump's racism  his sexism  xenophobia  and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement to not only defeat Trump  but to transform our economy and our government  17 You're wrong  Right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system  87 million uninsured or under insured  500 000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills  30 000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit  28 Five minutes away from here John is a country  It's called Canada  They guarantee health care to every man  woman  and child as a human right  They spend half of what we spent  And by the way  when you end up in a hospital in Canada  you come out with no bill at all  Healthcare is a human right  not a privilege  22 I believe that  I will fight for that  2 The fact of the matter is tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs  when their employer changes that insurance  If you want stability in the health care system  if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to doctor or hospital  20 Which is a system which will not bankrupt you  the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies  8 And the insurance companies  1    crosstalk 00 15 02   0 As the author of the Medicare bill  let me clear up one thing  If People talk about how the insurance  there are millions of people have insurance  they can't go to the doctor  And when they come out of the hospital  they go bankrupt  All right  What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co payments  And Jake  your question is a Republican talking point  At the end of the day  And by the way  the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program  36 Oh  Could I complete that  please  2 They will be advertising tonight with that talking point  3 It's not a business  1 let's be clear what this debate is about  Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system  What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years  the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent four and a half billion dollars of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions  That is why when I went to Canada the other day  people paid 1 10 the price in Canada for insulin that they're paying in the United States  33 Well  two things  They will be better because Medicare for All is comprehensive  It covers all healthcare needs  For senior citizens  it will finally include dental care  hearing aids and eyeglasses   crosstalk 00 11 53  12 Second of all  1 I do know it  I wrote the damn bill  And second of all  many of our union brothers and sisters  nobody more pro union than me up here  are now paying high deductibles and co payments  And when we do Medicare for All  instead of having the company putting money into healthcare  they can get decent wage increases  which they're not getting today   crosstalk 00 30 21  24 All right  On the Medicare for All  the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they're not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today   crosstalk 00 31 46  12 Second of all  maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare  but our job is for a nonprofit healthcare system  Furthermore  when we say  500 billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy  trying to deal with the health insurance companies  hospitals will be better off than they are today   crosstalk 00 32 09  22 Because we'll have the strong border protections  But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people  And as president  I will end that demonization  If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path  in my view  they are not criminals  They are people fleeing violence  29 And I think the main thing that we've got to do  among many others  and Beto made this point  we've got to ask ourselves why are people walking 2 000 miles to a strange country where they don't know the language  So  what we will do the first week we are in the White House is bring the entire hemisphere together  to talk about how we rebuild Hondouras  21   Guatemala  and El Salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries  4 Well  two things  A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform  It moves to humane border policy  in which by the way  we have enough administrative judges so that we don't have incredible backlogs that we have right now  19 But to answer your question  I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare  it is a human right that applies to all people in this country  And under a Medicare for all single payer system  we could afford to do that  14 I think we have got to do  I think what I meant is what President Obama said  and that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have the magical solution to the crisis  Now I come from one of the most rural states in America  I have a D minus voting record from the NRA  And as president  I suspect it will be an F record  20 What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA  You asked me about my record  Back in 1988  coming from a state that had no gun control  I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons  I lost that election  I will do everything I can  not only to take on the NRA  but to expand in great universal background checks  do away with the strong man provision  do away with the gun show loophole  and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs  39 Well  the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump  including the battleground states of Michigan  where I won the Democratic Primary  Wisconsin  where I won the Democratic primary  and Pennsylvania  And the reason we are going to defeat Trump and beat him badly  is that he is a fraud and a phony  and we're going to expose him for what he is  26 The American people want to have a minimum wage  which is a living wage  15 bucks an hour  I've helped lead that effort  The American people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs  not the highest prices in the world  I've helped lead the effort for that as well  16 Okay  0 John  0 John  I was a mayor  and I helped transform my city  I have some practical experience  Second of all  interestingly enough  today is the anniversary of Medicare  54 years ago under Lyndon Johnson and a democratic congress  they started a new program  After one year  it had 19 million elderly people in it  Please don't tell me that  in a four year period  we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35  This is not radical  This is what virtually every other country on Earth does  32 We are the odd guy out  0 He just mentioned plans  1 Detroit was mentioned  and I'm delighted Detroit is rebounding  Let us understand  Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the street as they moved to low wage countries  To win this election and to defeat Donald Trump  which by the way  in my view  is not going to be easy  we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision  We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen  33 By  among other things  making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt  6 I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas  Republicans are not afraid of big ideas  They could give  1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations  They could bail out the crooks on Wall Street  So please don't tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry  and nothing happens unless we do that  27 Here is the bottom line  We got to ask ourselves a simple question  What do you do with an industry that knowingly  for billions of dollars in short term profits  is destroying this planet  I say that it's criminal activity  16   that cannot be allowed to continue  1 Look  on this issue  my friends  there is no choice  We have got to be super aggressive  if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable  So I don't disagree with Tim  What that means is we got to A  take on the fossil fuel industry  B  it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and a hell of a lot of good union jobs as we do that  We've got to transform our transportation system  39 And we have to lead the world  1   because this is not just an American issue  1 Look  Steve  ain't nobody in the Congress who's more strongly pro worker than I am  So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry  what I am also talking about is a just transition  All right  We can create  and what the Green New Deal is about  it's a bold idea  We can create millions of good paying jobs  We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated  So we are not anti worker  We are going to provide  make sure that those workers have a transition  New jobs  healthcare and education  33 Yes  0 Well  I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation  which is called 10 20 30  And what that understands is that  as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare  in education  in financial services  we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America  including African American communities  In terms of education  I also have a plan  It's called the Thurgood Marshall Plan  and it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America  It would triple funding for Title I schools  It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least  60 000 a year  50  inaudible 00 04 21   1  crosstalk 00 04 22   0 Oh  I'm sorry  2 Yeah  okay  You're looking  I believe  at that the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements  NAFTA  PNTR with China  which costs us over four million jobs  but also helped lead the effort against these agreements  19 Now  Elizabeth is absolutely right  If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker  you're mistaken  If they can save five cents by going to China  Mexico  or Vietnam  or any place else  that's exactly what they will do  17 As president  let me tell you what I will do  These guys line up at the federal troughs  They want military contracts  they want all kinds of contracts  Well  under my administration  you ain't going to get those contracts if you throw American workers out on the street  15 As a matter of fact  I do  but before I get into that  the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress  you don't talk about in the media  is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America  You got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90   You got 1  that owns more wealth than the bottom 92   49  of all new income goes to the top 1   27 Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax  and we've got 500 000 people sleeping out on the street  What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans  they'll participate in our society  but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes  period  24 Trump is a pathological liar  I tell the truth  We have been in Afghanistan I think 18 years  in Iraq 16 or 17 years  We have spent  5 trillion on the war on terror  and there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began  23 We're going to spend  The Congress passed  and I will not vote for  a  715 billion military budget more than the 10 next countries combined  What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy  ending conflicts by people sitting at a table  not by killing each other  As president of the United States  I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it  not attack the UN  but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully  The United States  42   cannot be the policeman of the world  2 Could I add something to that discussion  1 Well  Pete is right  It's a question of vision  that's what it is  Whether you're young  whether you're old  whether you're in between  And my vision among other things says that if we're going to fight for healthcare  we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies  And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who in my view are going to war against the American people in terms of healthcare  That's a new vision  34 A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today  for the first time in modern American history  will have a lower standard of living than their parents  17 As somebody who grew up in a family that lived in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn  New York and lived paycheck to paycheck  I'm running for president not just to defeat the most dangerous president in this history of this country  a guy who's a racist  and a sexist and a homophobe  I'm running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of America  which for the last 45 years has been decimated  31 Two days ago  I had a remarkable experience  which should tell you everything you need to know about what's going on in America  I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit a few miles into Canada  and we bought insulin for one tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today  24 It's not just the price fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry  it's what's going on in the fossil fuel industry  It's what's going on in Wall Street  It's what's going on with the prison industrial complex  We need a mass political movement  20 Please go to BernieSanders com  Become one of our million volunteers  Stand up and take on the greed and corruption of the ruling class of this country  Let's create a government and an economy that works for all of us not just the one percent  20 Okay  Well  you're quite right  We have a new vision for America  And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America  while 500 000 people are sleeping out on the streets today  we think it is time for change  real change  And by that I mean that healthcare  in my view  is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for All  single payer system  31 Under that system  by the way  vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now  11 I believe that education is the future for this country  and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt  and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street  19 Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for  5 People who have healthcare on the Medicare for All will have no premiums  no deductibles  no co payments  no out of pocket expenses  Yes  they will pay more taxes but less in healthcare for what they get  14 Well  I think the responses at the polls  the last poll I saw has us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump because the American people understand that Trump is a phony  that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist  and that he lied to the American people during his campaign  23 He said he was going to stand up for working families  well President Trump  you're not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their healthcare that they have  and that 83  of your tax benefits go to the top 1   That's how we beat Trump  We expose him for the fraud that he is  19 It's part of Joe's generation  1 It's part of Joe's generation  1 Let me respond  1 The issue  if I may say  is not generational  0 The issue is not generational  0  crosstalk 00 16 21   0 The issue is who has the guts to take on Wall Street  to take on the fossil fuel industry  to take on the big money interests who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this county  16 Listen  I find it hard to believe that other major country on earth  including my neighbor 50 miles north me  Canada  somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man  woman and child  and in most cases  they're spending 50  per capita what we are spending  Let's be clear  Let us be very clear  25 The function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective  is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way  The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies  Last year  if you could believe it  while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs  and I will lower the prescription drug prices in half in this country  Top 10 companies made  69 billion dollars in profit  32 They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars lying to the American people  telling us why we cannot have a Medicare for All  crosstalk 00 23 35   10 I'm sorry  0 I will tell you how we'll do it  We'll do it way real change has always taken place  whether it was the Labor Movement  the Civil Rights Movement  or the Women's Movement  We will have Medicare for All  When tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone  that healthcare is a human right  not something to make huge profits off of  27 Just very briefly  You know Mike  Medicare is the most popular health insurance  7 Program in the country  People don't like their private insurance companies  They like their doctors and hospitals  Under our plan  people go to any doctor they want  any hospital they want  We will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in the country because we'll stop the greed of the insurance company  crosstalk 00 27 43   18 I want to suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said  And that is on day one  we take out our executive order pen  and we rescind every damn thing on this issue  that Trump has done  13 Number two  picking up on the point that Joe made  We got to look at the root causes  And you have a situation where Honduras  among other things  is a failing state  massive corruption  You've got gangs who are telling families  that if a ten year old does not join that gang  that family is going to be killed  20 What we have got to do on day one is invite the Presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together  This is a hemisphere problem that we have got to address  9 No  Absolutely not  Unlike the Republican party  we encourage diversity  we believe in diversity  That's what America is about  In addition to diversity in terms of having more women  more people from the LGBT community  we also have to do something else  21 That is we have to ask ourselves a simple question  How come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1  has seen a  21 trillion increase in their wealth  23 We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country  13 Well  my plan as somebody who believes for a start that a woman's right to control her own body is a constitutional right that government and politicians should not infringe on that right  We will do everything we can to defend Roe vs Wade  17 Second of all  let me make a promise here  You ask about a litmus test  My litmus test is I will never appoint  nominate  any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100  clear he or she will defend Roe v  Wade  18 Third of all  I do not believe in packing the court  We got a terrible 5 4 majority conservative court right now  I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts  That brings new blood into the Supreme Court and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run  crosstalk 00 16 29   31 Well  first of all  let me tell you this  It didn't even come up yet but let's taste this  Medicare For All guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it  14 Look  the old ways are no longer relevant  The scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet  This is a global issue  What the President of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change  but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of destruction  let us get together for the common enemy  and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy  32 The future of the planet rests on us doing that   crosstalk 00 25 22  3 Take on the fossil fuel  crosstalk 00 25 32  2 I reject the premise that there's only one or two issues out there  This country  4 This country faces enormous crises  1 We need a political revolution  People have got to stand up  3 And take on the special interests  We can transform this country  4 No  0 That's a mis characterization of my thinking  1 Look  we have a gun crisis right now  40 000 people a year are getting killed  In 1988  Rachel  when it wasn't popular  I ran on a platform of banning assault weapons  and in fact  lost that race for Congress  I have a D minus voting record from the NRA and I believe that what we need is comprehensive gun legislation that  among other things  provides universal background  We end the gun show loophole  We end the straw man provision  I believed in 1988  and I believe today that assault weapons  crosstalk 00 36 53  are weapons are from the military and that they should not be on the streets of America  53 We ban the sale and distribution  2 And that's what I believed for many years  2 If the government wants to do that  if people want to bring them back  3 Yes  1 It's not one country  I think it is rebuilding trust in the United Nations  and understand that we can solve conflicts without war  but with diplomacy  9 One of the differences   One of the differences that Joe and I have in our record is Joe voted for that war  I helped lead the opposition to that war  which is a total disaster  Second of all  I helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the War Powers Act  to get the United States out of the sorely  led intervention in Yemin  which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on Earth  And thirdly  let me be very clear  I will do everything I can to prevent a war with Iran  which would be far worse than disastrous war with Iraq  36 I suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying   These are good people  They have great ideas   But how come nothing really change  How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class  How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty  How come 45 million people still have student debt  How come three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America  And here is the answer  Nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street  the insurance industry  the pharmaceutical industry  the military industrial complex  and the fossil fuel industry  If we don't have the guts to take them on  we'll continue to have plans  we'll continue to have talk  and the rich will get richer  and everybody else will be struggling  53 
Michael Bloomberg,Senator  5 I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he's president  I do not think so  Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be President of the United States  And that's why Russia is helping you get elected so you lose to him  19 We let it get out of control  And when I realized that I cut it back by 95   And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness  I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of  12  inaudible 00 12 00  I've met with Black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time  But let me tell you  I have been working very hard  We've improved the school system for Black and Brown students in New York City  We've increased the jobs that are available to them  We've increased the housing that's available to them  We have programs like the  21 I think they just  1 No  Well  that's because it's in their interest to promote that  But if you talk to the people in New York City  I have over 100 Black elected officials that have endorsed me  A lot of them are in the audience tonight  And I've earned the respect of people in New York City  I was the mayor of the largest  most populous city in the United States for 12 years  and people will tell you it's a lot better city today  It is safer for everybody  The school system is better  The budget's under control  We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities  36 Wait a second  I know that if I were Black  my success would have been a lot harder to achieve  And I know a lot of Black people that if they were White  it would've been a lot easier for them  That's just a fact  and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it  15 I have been training for this job since I stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9 11  I know what to do  I've shown I know how to run a country  I've run the city which is almost the same size   is bigger than most countries in the world  I'm the one choice that makes some sense  I have the experience  I have the resources  and I have the record  And all those sideshows that the Senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that  When people hired me to run New York City three times  in an overwhelmingly Democratic  progressive city  they elected me again and again  39 Never said that  2 Oh  come one  1 That  3 I never said that  2 And for the record  if she was a teacher in New York City  she would never have had that problem  We treated our teachers the right way  and the unions will tell you exactly that  9 Probably wrong to make the jokes  I don't remember what they were  so I assume if it bothered them  I was wrong  and I apologize  I'm sorry for that  But what happened here is we went back 40 years  and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable  Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two  And what the Senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement  I did that two days later  and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again  The Senator has got it  and I don't know what else she wants us to do  36 We're following exactly what she asked to do  3 And the trouble is with this Senator  enough is never enough for what this   I'm going to start focusing on some of these other things  We just cannot continue to re litigate this every time  We did what she asked  And  thank you  we've probably made the world better because of it  And by my company renouncing using these  we probably changed  hopefully  the corporate landscape all across America  21 I  0   never said it  Period  End of story  3 Categorically never said it  When I was accused of doing it  we couldn't figure out what she was talking about  But right now  I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard or whatever happened  I didn't take any pleasure in that  And we've just got to go on  But I never said it  Come on  18 We are doing that  Senator  2 Okay  let me say something  2 Let's just go on the record  They talk about 40 Democrats  21 of those were people that I spent  100 million to help elect  All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president  I got them  Number two  when you talk about money  let's put this in perspective  The federal budget is four and a half trillion dollars a year  We get three and a half trillion dollars in revenue  We lose  1 trillion a year  That's why the federal budget deficit is   Right now  the debt is  20 trillion going up to 21  We just cannot afford some of the stuff people talk about  But if you   Let me finish  If you keep on going  we will elect Bernie  Bernie will lose to Donald Trump  And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the State Houses will all go red  And then between gerrymandering and appointing judges  for the next 20 or 30 years  we're going to live with this catastrophe  61 The polls aren't the election  2 Can anybody in the room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him  4 And you have to that or you can't win  0 Time out  I think she recognized me  thank you  I have a six million person organization around this country  Moms Demand Action  in every town  We have put background checks  We've got background checks in 20 states  So you can do it  It's Congress that can't seem to do it and I don't know why we think they're going to do it  The Vice President voted for a death bill and supported the NRA  and certainly Sanders has supported the NRA  But we can do this  We just got to stop talking about it  They want it both ways  30 Yes  we did  0 I'm not sure they're appropriate every place  I can only tell you in New York  they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them  The charter schools are mixed in with the non charter public schools  because our charter schools are public schools as well  They've helped each other  Saw a statistic the other day  When I came into office  zero New York City schools were in the top 25 of the state  When I left  23 out of 25 were from New York City  We've cut the gap between the rich and the poor  We've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have  I raised teacher's salaries by 43   I put an extra  5 billion into our school system  I value education  It is the only ways to solve the poverty problem  is to get people a good education  And rather than just talk about it in New York  we actually did it  52 Yes  I'm sorry  but unfortunately  she's misinformed on redlining  You can go back and look at the record  I fought against it before '08  the crisis  during '08  and after that  Redlining is not the problem with the mortgage market  but it was a problem for the communities where it was done  and we stopped that  Let me also say  since I have the floor for a second  that I really am surprised that all of these  my fellow contestants up here  I guess would be the right word for it  given nobody pays attention to the clock  I'm surprised they show up  because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that  42 But let me just say  when you're talking about affordable housing  we created 175 000 units of affordable housing in New York City  and I listened to them  they're in Congress  and they say that can't get it done  can't get it done  but if you change something like the president  they would  No  You have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle  and then you can get stuff done  I did it in New York City  I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage  virtually before anybody else in this country  You can work across the aisle  You just have to know how to deal with people  31 Well  I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right  but all the other cities  otherwise you'd have a naked cowboy in every city  So let's get serious here  But I do think it's the government's job to have good science  and to explain to people what science says  or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives  We are a country where there are too many people that are obese  We should do something about that  But just take a look at what happened with smoking  We did ban smoking in New York City  in public places  restaurants  offices  and that sort of thing  And it has spread across America  across Europe  across Latin America  even into places in the Middle East  and into the far East  It has saved an enormous number of lives  42 So it just goes to show if you have good public health  then you can do things  And one of the great problems today  you read about the virus  What's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialists in this country two years ago  so there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing  and he's defunded Centers for Disease Control  CDC  so we don't have the organization we need  This is a very serious thing  as you see  the stock market's falling apart  because people are really worried and they should be  We don't have anybody to respond  I'm sorry  35 There's no question about that  Before I left  life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years  during our 12 years in office  such that when I left  it was three years greater than the national average  14 Look  the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing  if you have a small amount  For dealers  yes  but for the average person  no  and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before  Number two  we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it  But number three  you should listen to the scientists and the doctors  they say go very slowly  they haven't done enough research  and the evidence so far is worrisome before we get all our kids  particularly kids in their late teens  boys even more than girls  where this may be damaging their brains  Until we know the science  it's just nonsensical to push ahead  but the cats out of the bag  So some states have it  You're not going to take it away  Get rid of the  decriminalize the possession  48 No  You want to cut it back as much as you can  but I think if we learned something from 9 11  people plan things overseas and execute them here  We have to be able to stop terrorism  And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it  but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate  and to not do so is just irresponsible  We shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win  we should go to war only as a last resort  Nobody argues with that  But this is a dangerous world  and if we haven't learned that after 9 11  I don't know what's going to teach us what to do  We have to do something  and I think the budget that we  Things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they've been in an awful long time  and that the moneys they are spending on the war are for  49  weapons we need for the next war and  1  not for the last  a common mistake that they're not making now  3 They're doing a good job  1 No  I would not  And I think the Chinese government has not been open  Their press  the freedom of press  does not exist there  Their human rights record is abominable  and we should make a fuss  which we've been doing  I suppose  But make no mistake about it  we have to deal with China if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis  We have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked  We would not be able to sell or buy the products that we need  29 And in terms of whether he's a dictator  he does serve at the behest of the Politburo  their group of people  But there's no question he has an enormous amount of power  But he does play to his constituency  You can negotiate with him  That's exactly what we have to do  make it seem that it's in his interest and it's in his people's interest to do what we want to do  Follow the rules  particularly no stealing of intellectual property  Follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions  39 I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago  We've been working on our tax returns  I've said there'll be out  we probably have another couple of weeks left to go  We're doing it as fast as we can  We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure  and when I was mayor of New York  we had our tax returns out 12 years in a row  and we will do that in the White House  19 How many years  0 Well  the battles been going on for a long time in the Middle East  whether it's the Arabs versus the Persians  the Shias versus the Sunnis  the Jews in Israel and the Palestinians  it's only gone on for 40 or 50 years  Number one  you can't move the embassy back  We should not have done it without getting something from the Israeli government  but it was done  and you're going to have to leave it there  Number two  only solution here is a two state solution  The Palestinians have to be accommodated  The real problem here is you have two groups of people  both of who think God them the same piece of land  And the answer is to obviously split it up  leave the Israeli borders where they are  Try to push them to pull back some of those extra  over on the other side of the wall where they've built these new communities  which they should not have done that  Pull it back  53 Misconception that I'm six feet tall  and quote  I've trained for this job for a long time and when I get it  I'm going to do something rather than just talk about it  17 I don't think there's any chance of the Senator beating President Trump  You don't start out by saying   I've got 160 million people  I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love   That's just not a ways that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders' camp thinks that they can do  I don't think there's any chance whatsoever  and if he goes and is the candidate  we will have Donald Trump for another four years and we can't stand that  31 I think we have two questions to face tonight  One is  who can beat Donald Trump  And number two  who can do the job if they get into the White House  And I would argue that I am candidate that can do exactly both of those things  I'm a New Yorker  I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump that comes from New York  I'm a mayor  I was a mayor  I know how to run a complicated city  the biggest  most diverse city in this country  I'm a manager  I knew what to do after 9 11 and brought the city back stronger than ever  And I'm a philanthropist who didn't inherit his money  but made his money  And I'm spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump  the worst President we have ever had  And if I can get that done  it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids  54 What am I  Chicken liver  1 I am a fan of Obamacare  At the beginning   2 Mr Vice President  I just checked the record because you'd said one time that I was not  In '09 I testified and gave a speech before the mayor's conference in Washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on  And I think at that time I wrote an article praising Obamacare  It was either in the New York Post or the Daily News  so the facts are  I was  crosstalk 00 25 56  24 Let me finish  Thank you  I was in favor of it  I thought it didn't do   go as far as we should  What Trump has done to this is a disgrace  The first thing we've got to do is get the White House and bring back those things that will left and then find a ways to expand it  Another public option to having some rules about capping charges  All of those things  We shouldn't just walk away and start something that is totally new  untried  People  crosstalk 00 26 27  31 Well  if I go back and look at my time in office  the one thing that I'm really worried about  embarrassed about  was how it turned out with Stop and Frisk  When I got into office  there was 650 murders a year in New York City  I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live  That's the basic right of everything  And we started  we adopted a policy which had been in place  The policy that all big police departments use of stop and frisk  36 What happened  however was it got out of control  And when we discovered  I discovered  that we were doing many  many  too many stop and frisks  we cut 95  of it out  I've sat down with a bunch of African American clergy and business people to talk about this  to try to learn  I've talked to a number of kids who'd been stopped  I was trying to understand how we change our policies so we can keep the city safe because the crime rate did go from 650  50  down  to 300  And we have to keep lid on crime  but we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately  That was what was happening  44 Yes  I would  I've sat  I've apologized  I've asked for forgiveness  but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people  We stopped too many people and we've got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country  There is no great answer to a lot of these problems  If we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel  everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers  there'd be nobody else up here  30 25 years ago  2 Yes  0 It just takes us a long time  Unfortunately or fortunately  3 Fortunately  I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world and we are preparing it  The number of pages will probably be in the thousands of pages  I can't go to Turbo Tax  but I put out my tax return every year for 12 years in city hall  We will put out this one  It says  tells everybody everything they need to know about every investments that I make and where the money goes  And the biggest item is all the money I give away  and we list that  Every single donation I make  and you can get that from our foundation anytime you want  36 We're releasing them  They'll be out in a few weeks  and that's just as fast as I can do it  Remember  I only entered into this race 10 weeks ago  All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years  13 And we did not  crosstalk 00 39 52  0 Wish it were that simple  0 It would save me a lot of money  1 Let me say a couple things and if I can have my full minute and a quarter  Thank you  I have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the Me Too Movement has exposed  And anybody that does anything wrong in our company  we investigate it  And if it's appropriate  they're gone that day  But let me tell you what I do in my company and my foundation and in city government when I was there  In my foundation  the person that runs  it's a woman  70  of the people there are women  In my company  lots and lots of women have big responsibilities  They get paid exactly the same as men  And in city hall  the person that's the top person  my deputy mayor was a woman and 40  of our commissioners were women  52 I am very proud of the fact that about two weeks ago we were awarded  we were voted the most   the best place to work  second best place in America  If that doesn't say something about our employees and how happy they are  I don't know what does  19 We have a very few nondisclosure agreements  4 Let me finish  0 None of them accused me of doing anything other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told  These would be agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and that's up to them  They signed those agreements and we'll live with it  16 Senator  no  0 Senator  the company and somebody else  in this   the man or a woman or could be more than that  they decided when they made an agreement that they wanted to keep it quiet for everybody's interests  16 They sign the agreements and that's what we're going to live  2 I heard your question  1 I've said  we're not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect that they will stay private  11 Wait  wait  1 Well  already we've closed 304 out of the 530 coal fired power plants in the United States  And we've closed 80 out of the 200 or 300 that are in Europe  Bloomberg Philanthropies working with the Sierra club  That's one of the things you do  But just let's start at the beginning  If you're president  the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris Agreement  This is just ridiculous for us to drop out  Two  America's responsibility is to be the leader in the world and if we don't  we're the ones that are going to get hurt just as much as anybody else  And that's why I don't want to have us cut off our relationships with China because you will never solve this problem without China and India  Western Europe and America  That's for most of the  crosstalk 00 54 50   Let me just finish one other thing  I believe  and you can tell me whether this is right  but the solar array that the vice president was talking about is being closed because it's not economic  That you can put solar panels in and modern technology  even more modern than that  58 Well  you're not going to go to war with them  You have to negotiate with them and try to   and we've seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us  What you have to do is convince the Chinese that is in their interest as well  Their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we work together  In all fairness  the Chinese have slowed down  It's India that is even bigger problem  but it is an enormous problem  nobody's doing anything about it  We could right here in America make a big difference  We're closing the coal fired power plants  If we enforced some of the rules on fracking so that they don't release methane into the air and into the water  you'll make a big difference  But we're not going to get rid of fracking for while and we frack incidentally not just natural gas  you frack oil as well  It is a technique and when it's done poorly  like they're doing it in too many places where the methane gets out into the air  it is very damaging  50 But it's a transition fuel  I think the Senator said it right  We want to go to all renewables  but that's still many years from now  And before  I think the Senator mentioned 2050 for some data  No scientist thinks the numbers for 2050 or 2050 anymore  They're 2040  2035  The world is coming apart faster than any scientific study had predicted  We just got to do something now  crosstalk 01 04 46   27 I'm the only one here that's started a business  3 No  That's exactly wrong  1 Well on the record against red lining  since I worked on Wall Street  I was against it during the financial crisis  I've been against it since the financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages packaged them and other people bought them  That was where all the disaster was  Red lining is still a practice some places and we've got to cut it out  but it's just not true  26 What I was going to say  maybe you want to talk about businesses  I'm the only one here I think that's ever started a business  Is that fair  Okay  What do we need is  I can tell you in New York City we had programs  There are mentoring programs for the young business people so they can learn how to start a business  We had programs that could get them seed capital  We have programs to get branch banking in their neighborhoods  because if you don't have a branch bank there  you can't get a checking account  can't get a checking account  you can't get a loan  You can't get a loan  you can't get a mortgage  Then you don't have any wealth  There's ways to fix this and it doesn't take trillions of dollars  It takes us to focus on the problems of small business  38 Senator  you're writing the tax code  Why are you complaining  Who wrote the code  5 You and the other 99 Senators  0 Yes  those are the Democrats  thank you  2 I can't speak for all billionaires  All I know is I've been very lucky  made a lot of money and I'm giving it all away to make this country better  And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic Party as well  10 Yes  I worked very hard for it  And I'm giving it away  5 Absolutely not  I can't think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation  This is ridiculous  We're not going to throw out capitalism  We tried that  Other countries tried that  It was called communism and it just didn't work  19 Wait a second  1 What a wonderful country we have  the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses  What'd I miss here  7 That's the first problem  2 That's good  0 New York  New York city  Thank you very much  And I pay all my taxes and I'm happy to do it because I get something for it  And let me say  I thought that the senator next to me was half right  10 I agree  We should raise taxes on the   I disagree with the senator on the wealth tax  but I do agree with her that the rich aren't paying their fair share  We should raise taxes on the rich  I did that as mayor in New York City  I raised taxes and if you take a look at my plans  the first thing I would do is try to convince Congress  because they've got to do it  we can't just order it  to roll back the tax cuts that the Trump administration put in through Congress  33 Whatever the rules of the for the Democratic Party are they should be followed  If they have a process  which I believe they do  6   so that everybody else  0 Everybody can  3 Yes  1 Well you can join me at mikebloomberg com too if you want but I'm not asking for any money  8 Look  this is a management job and Donald Trump's not a manager  This is a job where you have to build teams  he doesn't have a team so he goes and makes decisions without knowing what's going on or the implications of what he does  We can not run the railroad this way  This country has to pull together and understand that the people that we elect  and it's not just the president of the United States  they should have experience  they should have credentials  they should understand what they're doing and the implications thereof  Then we should  as a society  try to hold them accountable so the next time they go before the voters  if they haven't done the job we shouldn't just say   Oh nice person  gives a good speech   We should say   Didn't do the job and you're out of here   46 
Pete Buttigieg,We know what the President   what Russia wants  it's chaos  3 I'll tell you what the Russians want  They don't have a political party  They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way  I mean  look  if you think the last four years has been chaotic  divisive  toxic  exhausting  imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump  Think about what that will be like for this country  And meanwhile  folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us  Because it's right that there is a progressive majority  an American majority that wants to see real change  wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement  But also there's the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV  see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof  We have an opportunity to set a different tone  62 Let's clear this up once and for all  2 I can't allow this to stand because it's just not true  Senator Sanders has got people believing  crosstalk 00 09 21  something that is untrue about my campaign  The idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires  9 50 people  All right  in Charleston alone  just in Charleston  over 2000 people have contributed to my campaign  That means the dollars that have come to my campaign just from Charleston is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned  Grassroots contributions are the lifeblood of my campaign  In fact  I shouldn't miss the opportunity  If you're watching right now and you support my campaign  go to peteforamerica com and chip in  And if you're watching right now and you're a billionaire  I will raise your taxes  But if you'd like to defeat Donald Trump  please go to peteforamerica com and donate the legal maximum of  2 800 if you're a billionaire  41 Yes  In effect  it was  Because it was about profiling people based on their race  And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped White people too often and minorities too little  And I'm not here to score points  I come at this with a great deal of humility  because we have had a lot of issues  especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community  24 And I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven White people on this stage talking about racial justice  None of us have the experience  the lived experience of  for example  walking down the street or in a mall and feeling eyes on us  regarding us as dangerous  without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin  None of us have the experience that Black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by  of going into a doctor and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race  39 Since we don't have the experience  the next best thing  2   we can do is actually listen to those who do  2  crosstalk 00 20 01   0 If you get nominated  we'll be re litigating this all year  3 We can do the math right now  0 I think we're talking about math  5 Let's talk about it  0 I think we were talking about math  And it doesn't take two hours to do the math  Because  let's talk about what it adds up to  5 Let's talk about math  indeed  1 Okay  so here's the math  2 Doing nothing is what will happen  1 Nothing is what will happen if we put forward a candidate  3 So let's do some math  Senator Sanders at one point said it was going to be 40 trillion  Then it was 30  Then it was 17  It's an incredible shrinking price tag  At some point has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be  Now there are new numbers  I'll tell you exactly what it adds up to  It adds up to four more years of Donald Trump  Kevin McCarthy is Speaker of the House  and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands  The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters  Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected  we got a House to worry about  We got a Senate to worry about  And this really important  37 If you want to keep the House in Democratic hands  you might want to check with the people who actually turned the House blue  40 Democrats who are not running on your platform  11 They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can  I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House  6 Let's listen to them  1 When they say that they don't want to be out there defending Senator Sanders  3 That's why we've got to change what Washington can deliver  3 Okay  but wait a second  crosstalk 00 04 21  the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago  6 I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country  But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster  because this is not some long ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took  This is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds  And we're in South Carolina  How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change  We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly  No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reed has called for it to go  It has got to go  because otherwise Washington will not deliver  I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened and I remember everybody in Washington saying   Never again  We'll never let this happen again   And then a second school shooting generation has now been produced  Shame on us if we allow there to be a third  59 In terms of making the case  I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate from the perspective of a veteran why the kinds of weaponry  anything remotely like what I trained on in order to go serve in a war zone  has no business being sold anywhere near an American school or church or neighbor  22 The best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators  I'm a little biased  because I'm married to one  and I get an education about education every day I come home  I have seen how teachers are being expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms  Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing  because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids  And now some politicians  because they aren't willing to face the need for common sense gun law  are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom  We have to show not only with compensation  but with support for the profession overall  our regard for those who are educating our kids  And yes  that means a Secretary of Education who will support teachers  It also means investing  I'm proposing an Education Access Corps that would show that we are going to honor our teachers a little better  55 That's what my plan would do through the Education Access Corps  3 Yeah  When I was born  there was no difference in your life expectancy if you were born in a rural area or a city  Now the gap is the biggest it's been in a generation  And that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina  We're seeing hospital closures right and left  and we're seeing them in particular in states where Medicaid was not expanded  something that is hurting black and poor white families  and is largely the result of racial voter suppression  See  all of these things are connected  Housing  wages  the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform  All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation  which is happening on everything from the purging of voter roles  to the closing of voting locations  And that harms everybody  It's why in my Frederick Douglass Plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues  part of the core of it is a 21st century Voting Rights Act  60 But in order for any of that to happen at us to pass  3 And we're talking about a plan that goes beyond what even what they do  3 Well  the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina  it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson  That was to get ready to go to Afghanistan  where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe  just as sure as my body armor  was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word  Our allies and our adversaries knew it  The president has torn that to shreds  And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States  35 Second thing we got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities  And I guess I disagree with the mayor  I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather  because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world  But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground  But what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them  Right now  some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter terrorism  but issues like global health security and the coronavirus that rely on the ability to listen to scientists  32  listen to your own intelligence  and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated  6  NAME  3 I'm worried about Xi Jinping in the context of the virus  too  1 You know  you can find tax returns online right now  1 Yes  because there's no comparing those two commentaries  2 What Barack Obama was doing was opening diplomatic doors  What you were doing is making excuses  0 This is 2020  We can't be reliving the Cold War  0 The only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency  and I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s  and Bernie Sanders with the nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s  This is not about what cous were happening in the 1970s or '80s  this is about the future  This is about 2020  We are not going to survive or succeed  and they're certainly not going to win by reliving the Cold War  and we're not going to win these critical  critical House and Senate races  if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the democratic party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime  We've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future  57 Glad you brought this up  Let's talk about that  2 I'm happy to respond to the question  because this is really important  2 No  if you're going to ask that rhetorical question  let's go behind the  3 Let's talk about what's radical about that plan  Senator  please  2 Senator  the things you just named are the things we favor but  the way you're talking about doing it is radical by  4 we've got to open this up  Universal healthcare for example  3 I've got to respond to the question that Senator Sanders  3 First of all  I stand with the people of Idlib  who are being targeted  as you said  in a brutal fashion by a dictatorship that has already been so brutal for so many years  And this is one of the reasons we have got to change the balance of power in the region  because the president has basically vanished from the stage  when it comes to even playing a role in the future there  Turkey  Russia  Iran  all have so much more of a say than we do  We don't have to be invading countries to be making a difference working with our international partners in order to deliver peace  and support those who are standing up for self determination  Now I want to come back to something  and I promise it relates to international affairs  because Senator Sanders asked me a question earlier  He asked the question of whether healthcare for everybody is a radical idea  And it's not  which is why I'm for it  very much in a different way though  What is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance  And part of how you know it is  is that no industrialized country has gone that far  62 He and I both like to talk about Denmark for example  but even in Denmark  they have not abolished the possibility of private insurance  So this is an idea that goes further than what is acceptable in Denmark  the country  let alone imagining how that's going to fly in Denmark  South Carolina  16 I think the biggest conception misconception is that I'm not passionate  I get that I'm kind of level  Some say unflappable  I don't think you want a president who's flappable  but it's precisely because I'm so passionate about the things that are going on in this country that I consider it important to approach all of that with discipline  And my disciplines are guided by the motto is I try to live by  many of which come from scripture  And just to be clear  I would never impose my interpretation of my religion on anybody  34 Just to sure as I'm wearing this ring  I'll never let that happen to anybody  But I seek to live by the teachings that say that if you would be a leader  you must first be a servant  And of course the teaching not unique to the Christian tradition  but a big part of it that holds that we are to treat others as we would be treated  And when I think about everything at stake  from racial and economic justice  to our stewardship of the climate  to the need to heal the sick  and the need to heal this country  I seek for those teachings to order my steps as I go through this campaign  and as I go through life  30 Yes  we've got to wake up as a party  We could wake up two weeks from today  the day after super Tuesday  and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg  the two most polarizing figures on this stage  And most Americans don't see where they fit  if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power  Let's put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle class neighborhood  in an industrial Midwestern city  Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat  Look  we shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out  We can do better  57 All right  Look  first of all   crosstalk 00 09 43  Look  my campaign is fueled by hundreds of thousands of contributors  11 Among the hundreds of thousands of contributors  And look  we've got to unite this country to deal with these issues  You're not the only one who cares about the working class  Most Americans believe we need to empower workers  As a matter of fact  you're the one who is at war with the Culinary Union right here in Las Vegas  We can't  21 We can  0 Yeah but the vision I'm putting forward has the support of the American people  3 We can actually deliver healthcare without taking it away from anyone  We can actually empower workers and lift wages without further polarizing this country and we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking democratic figures and union leaders alike  18 Senator  when you say that you disown these attacks and you didn't personally direct them  I believe you  5 But at a certain point you got to ask yourself  why did this pattern arise  Why is it especially the case among your supporters that this happens  7 That's just not true  People  3 But leadership is about what you draw out of people  It's about how you inspire people to act  And right now we're in this toxic political environment  Leadership isn't just about policy  I think  at least in broad terms  we're largely pulling in the same direction on policy  But leadership is also about how you motivate people to treat other people and I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign and in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others  Because in order to turn the page  33 I'm more of a Microsoft Word guy  And if you look at my plan  I don't know if there are any PowerPoints on it  but you can definitely find the document on peteforamerica com  And you'll see that it is a plan that solves the problem  makes sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and does it without kicking anybody off the plan that they have  This idea that the union members don't know what's good for them is the exact kind of condescension and arrogance that makes people skeptical of the policies we've been putting forward  29 Here we have a plan that the majority of Americans support  Do you realize how historic that is  That the American people are ready in a way  far beyond what was true even 10 years ago and what was available to President Obama at the time  There's a powerful American majority ready to undertake the biggest  most progressive reform we've had in healthcare in 50 years  just so long as we don't force it on anybody  What is wrong with that  26 That's not true  0 No  it's not because  first of all  let me say we are all delighted that you are in fighting shape  4 And at the same time  transparency matters  especially living through the Trump era  Now under president Obama  the standard was that the president would release full medical records  Do a physical and release the readout  I think that's the standard that we should hold ourselves to as well  Now  President Trump lowered that standard  He said just a letter from a doctor is enough  and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that's enough  But I am certainly prepared to get a physical  put out the results  I think everybody here should be willing to do the same  But I'm actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sander's personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his healthcare plan  42 Since he said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost  And even after raising taxes on everybody making  29 000  there is still a multi trillion dollar hole  Matter of fact  if you add up his policies altogether  they come to  50 trillion  He's only explained  25 trillion worth of revenue  which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States  25 The time has come to level with the American people on matters personal and on matters of policy  5 That's  1 This is really important   crosstalk 00 37 29  1 That's false  Look  if my plan is to status quo  why was it attacked by the insurance industry the moment it came out  And on issue after issue after issue  this is what Senator Sanders is saying  If you're not with him  if you're not all the way on his side  then you must be for the status quo  Well you know what  That is a picture that leaves most of the American people out  20 That's right  we have  0 Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves in backyards  crosstalk 00 39 53  1 They could release them now  1 To be super clear that was about the list of clients  so nobody gets the wrong idea  3 I know what you mean  no  you're right  2 Yeah  look  I wouldn't liken this to trivia  I'm actually didn't know how many members were in the Knesset  So you got me there  3 But you're staking your candidacy on your Washington experience  You're on the committee that oversees border security  You're on the committee that does trade  You're literally part of the committee that's overseeing these things and we're not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south  17 I'm saying you shouldn't trivialize that knowledge  1 This is the race for president  If winning a race for Senate in Minnesota translated directly to becoming president  I would have grown up under the presidency of Walter Mondale  This is different  And the reason that I think we need to talk about Washington experience is that we should ask what that experience has led to  Experiences and certainly tenure is not always the same thing as judgment  If we're going to talk about votes in the Senate in Washington  let's talk  crosstalk 00 49 38   24 Hold on  1 Let's be real about the deadline  It's not 2050  It's not 2040  It's not 2030  It's 2020  because if we don't elect a president who actually believes in climate science now  we will never meet any of the other scientific or policy deadlines that we need to  So first of all  let's make sure we're actually positioned to win  Which once again  if we put forward two of the most polarizing figures on this stage as the only option  it's going to be a real struggle  30 Now I've got a plan to get us carbon neutral by 2050  And I think everybody up here has a plan that more or less does the same  So the real question is how are we going to actually get it done  We need leadership to make this a national project that breaks down the partisan and political tug of war that prevents anything from getting done  20 How do you do it  Well  first of all  making sure that those jobs are available quickly  Secondly  ensuring that we are pulling in those very sectors who have been made to feel like they're part of the problem  from farming to industry  and fund as well as urge them to do the right thing  And then global climate diplomacy  I'm a little skeptical of the idea that convincing is going to do the trick when it comes to working with China  America has repeatedly overestimated our ability to shape Chinese ambitions  but what we can do is ensure that we use the hard tools  crosstalk 00 01 46   31  NAME  6 Not if they are small businesses  I mean what we've got to do is level the playing field  where a company like Amazon or Chevron is paying literally zero on billions of dollars in profits  And it puts small businesses like the ones that are revitalizing my own city  often Latino owned on our West side  at a disadvantage  We need to recognize that investing in Latino entrepreneurship is not just an investment in the Latino community  It is an investment in the future of America  And it is time for a President who understands the value of immigration in lifting up all of our communities and our country  We are getting the exact opposite message from the current president  And it is time to recognize not just the diversity of the Latino community but the importance of issues like economic empowerment  healthcare  as well as  crosstalk 00 05 23   47 I think that employee ownership of companies is a great idea  I'm not sure it makes sense to command those companies to do it  If we really want to deliver less inequality in this country  then we've got to start with the tax code  And we've got to start with investments in how people are able to live the American dream  which is in serious  serious decline  Matter of fact  last time I checked the list of countries to live out the American dream  in other words  to be born at the bottom and come out at the top  we're not even in the top 10 number  Number one place to live out the American dream right now is Denmark  33 And as the  I think  the lone person on this stage who's not a millionaire  let alone a billionaire  I believe that part of what needs to change is for the voices of the communities that haven't felt heard on Wall Street or in Washington to actually be brought to Capitol Hill  It's why I am building a politics designed around inclusion  designed around belonging  because the one thing that will definitely perpetuate the income inequality we're living with right now is for Donald Trump to be reelected because we polarize this country with the wrong nominees  34 No  Look  it's true that I was into Bernie before it was cool  6 He was a congressman at the time  and the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal  I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views then or now  but I appreciate that at least he's straightforward and honest about it  and he's honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than  29 000 00 to fund his health care plan  Although again  a little bit vague about how the rest of that gap  25 But you're still raising those taxes and when you do it  3 But where's the other  25 trillion supposed to come from  At a certain point  you got to do the math  8 No  but even after the payroll tax because you still have a hole  3 That's just not true  0 I'll be very clear  0 Oh  I think he should absolutely be doing everything in his power to defeat Donald Trump  I just don't think that has to result in him becoming the President of the United States  Look  our party has values  We were built around values like making sure we protect working people  but Mayor Bloomberg opposed raising the minimum wage  Our party has a tradition that includes excellent presidents like Barack Obama  who Mayor Bloomberg opposed  26 At the end of the day  it's not just about how much money you've got  it's what you stand for  And we are living at a moment when Americans are so deeply frustrated with the way that both Wall Street and Washington seem to have overlooked our lives  The view from the porch of my one house in Indiana is that they can't even see us sometimes  And if we're going into the election of our lives against a president who rose to power by cynically exploited the frustration of ordinary Americans feeling like leaders weren't speaking to them  then I think that turning to someone like Mayor Bloomberg who thinks he can buy this election is no better a way to succeed than turning to somebody like Senator Sanders who wants to burn the house down  52 If you're going to run based on your record of voting in Washington  then you have to own those votes  especially when it comes to immigration  You voted to confirm the Head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump  who was one of the architects of the family separation policy  You voted to make English the national language  Do you know the message that sends in as multilingual a state as Nevada  to immigrants  23 You have been unusual among Democrats  I think the Democrat among all of the senators running for President  most likely to vote for Donald Trump's judges who we know are especially hostile to Dreamers and to the rights of immigrants  Now in South Bend  it was not always easy to stand up in a conservative place like Indiana on immigration  but we delivered  We created a municipal ID program so that Dreamers and others who were undocumented were able to navigate everyday life  We stood up for those rights and stood with members of our community with the message that they were as American as we are  Spanish 00 33 31   34 I'm stating the facts because these are votes that you took  2 And those votes set you alone among the Democrats running for president  3 No other   Is it true or is it false that no other Democrat  5   from the Senate running for  0   president voted that way  0 Well I would say for anybody who ran for president this cycle  Senator Harris  3   Senator Booker saw to this  0 Maybe leading a diverse city that was facing ruin doesn't sound like the arena to you  I'm used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors  but this is the arena too  You don't have to be in Washington to matter  You don't have to be on Capital Hill  17   for  crosstalk 00 36 02  your work to be significant  1 The arena is everywhere  1 Not necessarily  Not till there's  1 Well Nevada I'm asking for your vote because America is running out of time  This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump  If you look at the choice between a revolution or the status quo and you don't see where you fit in that picture then join us  Yes  go for peteforamerica com and help out  because we need to draw everybody that we can who believes that we need to empower workers  who believes in climate science  who believes in doing something about gun violence and recognizes that the only way we can do this is to create a sense of belonging in this country that moves us out of the toxic and polarized moment that we are living in today  43 I already see an American majority ready to do these things  Now we have a responsibility to galvanize  not polarize  that majority  We can not afford to lean on the same Washington playbook  We can not afford to alienate half the country  We must step forward into the future in order to win and in order to govern a country that will be facing issues the likes of which we barely thought of just a few years ago  28 I'm asking you to join me  1   so that we can deliver that future together  2 I'm not interested in the labels  I'm not interested in what Republicans are going to say  I'm interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually  finally turn the page  In order to win  yes  but also in order to govern  This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadn't even thought of a few years or decades ago  And politically  we're facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump  So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar  Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification  when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says  if you don't go all the way to the edge  it doesn't count  A politics that says  it's my way or the highway  60 Yes  Because we've got to bring as many people as we can into this process  Look  all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that it's going to take in order to win  But the process of actually proving it is now underway  And now it comes to New Hampshire  a state that thinks for itself  is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging  Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on their side if we don't agree 100  of the time  39 I think there's a better way  It's true  the American people are ready  There's a historic majority right now  even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago  There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription  Just so long as we don't command people to accept a public plan if they don't want to  That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It  My point is  what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants  Yes  higher wages  doubling the rate of unionization in this country  making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share  delivering healthcare and college affordability  But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize  not polarize the American people  That is not only what we need in order to win  it's what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done  57 Sure  Well  first of all  just to be clear  the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American  And as to experience  I just bring a different perspective  Look  I freely admit that if you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt  you've got your candidate  and of course it's not me  The perspective I'm bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington  D C  Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation  Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room  We need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past  Turn the page and bring change to Washington before it's too late  52 Those achievements were phenomenally important  because they met the moment  but now we have to meet this moment  And this moment is different  The next president is going to face challenges from global health security  like what we're seeing coming out of China  to cybersecurity  and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago  And here at home  we're seeing things like gig work  transform what it means to be a worker in America  in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago  We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back  We have to be ready to turn the page  and change our politics before it's too late  And I'm seeing everywhere I go  not just fellow Democrats  but a striking number of independents  and  what I like to call future former Republicans ready to join in that historic American majority to turn the page  52 Here's how we're going to win  We're going to force this president to stand on that debate stage  next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood  in the industrial Midwest  in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for  but turns his back on  We're going to put up somebody who's not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast  and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party  We're going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn  and remind him what serving this country is really about  If we want to beat this president  we've got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past  and unify this country around a new and better vision  That's how we're going to win  And when I talk about exhaustion  this is important  because I got to tell you  the American people  from outside of Washington  we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division  and the dysfunction there  64 And that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of Congress  and the Senate are doing  It's not  But  the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it  I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that I've spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester  and in the other states that we're in  And the important thing for the American people to remember  is this is 2020  it's an election year  And if the Senate was the jury before  you are the jury now  The American people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president  and on the senators in the GOP who protected him  37 That's right  3 No  and we're not going to let them change the subject  This is not about Hunter Biden  or vice president Biden  or any Biden  This is about an abuse of power by the president  The vice president and I and all of us are competing  But we've got to draw a line here  And to be the kind of president  to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son  who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father  is an unbelievably dishonorable thing  that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term  49 In the situation that we saw with President Trump's decision  there is no evidence that that made our country safer  Look  I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated  It's also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq  it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing  This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war  but it didn't start with the Soleimani strike  It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working  And it's time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war  that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve  53 By chance  just because I was traveling for the campaign  not long ago  I ran into somebody that I hadn't seen since we were both serving  hadn't seen since she was injured in an insider attack  And I saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a Wounded Warrior Project tee shirt that said   Some assembly required   And when I asked her how she was doing  she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldn't save  tapped on the prosthetic and said the Navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment  33 The people in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them  What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence  pay attention to the international security situation  consult with our allies  keep US politics out of it  and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harm's way if there is an alternative  24 It depends on the circumstances  It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be  That's my point  This is not an episode of 24  This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture  This president has insulted the intelligence community  but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified  And I don't think he even reads it  28 And here we have a situation where the world  that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military  not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to Colonel Vindman  but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor  We deserve a better commander in chief  24 I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy  And looking forward  we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before  It's not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq  it's about preventing a war with Iran  And not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that we've been doing throughout  the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community  41 At a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats  in President Trump's imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators  It's a 17th century approach to keeping a place safe  What we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships  but defining a strategy to keep the American people safe from fundamentally new challenges  28 No  What I've called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession  15 Again  what I'm calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response  This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs  but also as we know from the opioid crisis  some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful  It's why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable  We've got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances  Even while we're also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue  not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction  42 That's why medication assisted treatment is so important  And those people who are being revived  and our own EMTs in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody  but then they have nowhere to go  Sometimes you get brought back with a dose of Narcan  but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you  because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country  We must act to change that and save lives when we do  30 Well  if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence  What I've called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench  but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process  We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today  And the time has come for us to think bigger  not just reforming the makeup of the court as America  by the way  has done several times in our history  But also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the Constitution for a reason and we shouldn't be afraid to use it  41 It's not something you do lightly or quickly  but when it comes to something like Citizens United  which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an op ed to your local paper  we need a Constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy  20 Well  the reality is  on my watch  drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average  and specifically to marijuana  lower than in Indiana  But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system  and my city was not immune  I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department  but we've got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies  28 Earlier  we were talking about opioids  and thankfully  America has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem  But there were a lot of people  including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point  it's great that everybody's so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids  but where were you when it came to marijuana  where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s  That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it  do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration  disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with  55 And again  the overall rate was lower than the national rate  4 And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target  when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence  which was slaughtering so many in our community  burying teenagers  disproportionately black teenagers  we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder  27 These things are all connected  but that's the point  So are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism  not just from criminal justice  but from our economy  from health  from housing  and from our democracy itself  16 We are going into the fight of our lives  Donald Trump  according to news reports  and his allies raised  25 million today  We need to go into that fight with everything that we've got  Now I've been very clear on both my record  where I have sued pharmaceutical companies  and what I'm campaigning for  that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy  And as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire  I know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of South Bend  Indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse  40 We are here without the involvement of any corporate PACs because hundreds of thousands of people went to  yes  peteforamerica com  contributed to this campaign  and let me say something else  If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here  we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump  And in order to do that  we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject  but how we bring everybody into the fold  And if you are low income  or if you're able to contribute a lot  If you've always voted Democrat  or if you're an Independent or even a Republican who's just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House  we need you to join us right now  I will not pursue politics by telling people they can't be at our side if they're not with us 100  of the time  This is a time for addition  not rejection  for belonging  not exclusion  60 The problem is  America's been counting the wrong things  Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good  I'm sure if you've got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street  then that really is the same thing as the economy to you  But the problem is  we've had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need  or even so many in the middle  26 When I'm president  we're going to measure the performance of our economy  not by the Dow Jones but by the income growth of the 90   because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty  Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate  in particular  the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have  This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change  The American people  not just die hard Democrats  but so many Independents and some Republicans  think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesn't happen  That is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics  To turn the page  leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late  54 Well  I bring a different perspective  There are enlisted people that I served with  barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9 11  on the war in Iraq  and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates  The next President is going to be confronted with national security challenges  different in scope and in kind from anything we've seen before  28 Not just conventional military challenges  not just stateless terrorism  but cybersecurity challenges  climate security challenges  foreign interference in our elections  It's going to take a view to the future  as well as the readiness  to learn from the lessons of the past and for me  those lessons of the past are personal  21 If we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops  But what's going on right now is the President's actually sending more  The very President who said he was going to end endless war  who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along  But we know that's not true  Now has more troops going into the Middle East  And whenever I see that happen  I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members  28 I remember walking with a friend of mine  another Lieutenant I trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasn't turning back to scoop him up  And it took all the strength he had  not to turn around and look at his boy one more time  That is happening by the thousands right now  as we see so many more troops sent into harm's way  And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as Commander in Chief  33 That authorization needs to be replaced  2 When we lost troops in  inaudible 00 19 21   there were members of Congress who admitted they didn't even know we had troops there  And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaeda and 9 11  And often Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role  Now thanks to Democrats in Congress  that's changing  But the reality is year after year  Congress didn't want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult  Fundamental truth is  if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm's way  often on deployment after deployment  then we've got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there  And when I am President  anytime  which I hope will never happen  but anytime I'm compelled to use force  I seek that authorization  We will have a three year sunset  so that the American people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue  54 Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons  will of course be a priority because it's such an important part of keeping America safe  But unfortunately  President Trump has made it much harder for the next President to achieve that goal  By gutting the Iran nuclear deal  one that by the way  the Trump administration itself admitted was working  certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran  By gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we're now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war  Now   crosstalk 00 23 46  Yes  39 In order to get that done  we've got to work with our partners  The Iran nuclear deal  the technical term for it was the JCPOA  that first letter J stood for joint  We can't do this alone  Even less so now after everything that has happened  which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders  including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal  but a widely shared goal around the world  to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear armed country  34 No  Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear  And by the way  we've got a lot other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world  Despite this President's coziness with Vladimir Putin  we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START  We've got to move toward less  not more nuclear danger  whether it is from States  from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world  30 Yes  it has been improved  It is not perfect  but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted  they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit  American consumers and workers and farmers  by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability  as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA  27 But let's acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration  In my part of the country  in the industrial Midwest  I remember when they came around in the '90s  selling trade deals  telling us   Don't worry about your slice of the pie  The pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off   and that promise was broken  The part about the pie getting bigger happened  It's just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not  27 That is why there was such frustration  The sense that these decisions in board rooms and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what's best for us  but based on their own game  8 Well  that's right  This issue's personal for me  That's why we're going to tackle climate from day one  It's why we've got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today  10 Now  what I've noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century  starting with actions that we take right now  The question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done  Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades  19 The other day in Winterset  there was a kid at one of my events  Raised his hand  and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties  in the year 2100  He will sit in judgment over what we do  not just what we on this stage do  anyone old enough to vote right now  whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals  to act aggressively  not just rejoining the Paris Climate Accord  That's table stakes  but to actually move on from the fossil dependent economy we live in today  36 Well  it's making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American  Look  The individual mandate was an important part of the ACA  because the system doesn't work if there are free riders  13 What I'm offering is a choice  You don't have to be in my plan if there's another plan that you would rather keep  and there's no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver healthcare for all  My plan is paid for  Look  Our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit  We've got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do  In my lifetime  it's almost invariably Republican Presidents who have added to the deficit   1 trillion under this President  34 It's why everything I've put forward  from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we're going to make an infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for  What comes to healthcare  you can do it in two moves  Of course  my plan costs  1 5 trillion over a decade  No small sum  but not the 20  30  40 that we're hearing about from the others  21 All I've got to do is two things  Both of them are common sense  Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices  and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations  10 Roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn't even need it  3 It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small  We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury  that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate  This would be a game changer  This would be the biggest thing we've done to American healthcare in a half century  24 Let's measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes  we're taking on costs on prescription drugs  we'll have an out of pocket cap  Even if you don't get the subsidies that would make it free  a  250 monthly cap and here's why it's got to be monthly  You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they've got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out of pocket cap hits  It makes no sense medically because most of us don't experience the economy on an annual basis  Our bills don't come in every year  They come in every month  Same with our paychecks  biweekly or monthly  That's why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20  30  40 trillion bills  42 It makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebody's income  We've got to drive it to 7  or below  and zero for those families who are living in poverty  But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum  I meet professionals who sometimes say that they're working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working  It makes no sense and it must change and we shouldn't be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality  Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large  We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody's like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason  she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in  and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career  63 Well  it's simple  We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade  It's not the same for college  Now again  I don't want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college  and under my plan it won't be  Matter of fact  for the first 80  of Americans by income  it is free at public colleges  but if you're in that top income bracket  don't get me wrong  I still wish you well  I hope you succeed when you go to college  I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else  34 There is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise  And we need to be using that to support everybody  whether you go to college or not  making sure that Americans can thrive  investing in infrastructure and something that hasn't come up very much tonight  but deserves a lot of attention  Poverty  you know  the Poor People's Campaign is marching on Iowa right now  calling on us to talk about this issue more  They are driven by their faith  I think  because even though in politics we're supposed to talk middle class  they know there's no scripture that says   As you've done under the middle class  so you've done unto me   37 We got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars  where they will make the biggest difference  And I don't think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition of public colleges is the best use of those scarce  crosstalk 01 23 52  taxpayer dollars  15 That's why we have to fight climate change with such urgency  Climate change has come to America from coast to coast  We're seeing it in Iowa  We've seen it in historic floods in my community  I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a  inaudible 01 38 04  flood  Then two years later  had to do the same thing  In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place  This is no longer theoretical  This is no longer off in the future  We have got to act  yes to adapt  to make sure our communities are more resilient  to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other  But we also have to ensure that we don't allow this to get any worse  And if we get it right  farmers will be a huge part of the solution  We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them  Whether we're talking about farmers  or industrial workers in my community  and make clear that we need to enlist them  63 In the national project to do something about this  1 We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose li  5    Funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency  And by the way  that is happening to farms  that is happening to factories and that disproportionally happens to black and brown Americans  which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward  18 The black voters who know me best are supporting me  That's why I have the most support in South Bend  It's why among elected black officials in my community  who have gotten into this race  by far most of them are supporting me  And now nationally  I am proud that my campaign has co chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders  From Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County  Now  the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted and I never will  The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that I'm perfect  It's because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can  46 Not from the luxury of a of a debate or a television panel or a committee room  but on the ground  Issues from poverty to justice in policing  And I'm proud to say we've been nationally recognized for our work as a race informed city on delivering greater economic justice  That we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing  Of course  there is a much longer way to go  in my community and around the country  But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work  34 You demoted me  I was actually an associate but that's okay  It was not the biggest part of my career  but I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on and guided that community through a historic transformation  When at the beginning of the decade I took office  we were described as a dying city  I'm ready to take on Donald Trump because when he gets to the tough talk and the chest thumping  he'll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve  38 And if and if he keeps trying to use religion   If a guy like Donald Trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit Christianity into the G O P   I will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that God does not belong to a political party  I am ready to take on this president on every front  26 This is our moment  This is our one shot to defeat Donald Trump and to do it by such a big margin that we send Trumpism into the dustbin of history too  Well  we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same Washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point  If you are watching this at home and you were exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction  I'm asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics  You're seeing the President boast about the Dow Jones wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table  Join me if you're a voter of color feeling taken for granted by politics as usual  Join me if you're used to voting for the other party  but right now cannot look your kids in the eye and explain this president to them  join me  57 We have a chance to change all of this if we can summon the courage to break from the past  That is why I am running for president  It is why I'm asking you to caucus for me on February 3rd and I hope that you will go to peteforamerica com and join me in this effort  17 At the end of the day  this is beyond public opinion  this is beyond polls  this is beyond politics  The president left the House with no choice  and I think a lot of us are watching this process  watching Washington go through the motions and not expecting much  but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate  We cannot give in to that sense of helplessness because that's what they want  They want us to be taken in by that cynicism where we give up on the process altogether  Meanwhile  their allies are laughing all the way to the bank  34 As we see policies that let giant corporations  some of which made billions in profits  pay  not just zero  but as we've recently learned  negative taxes  all while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working Americans  Here's the good news   it's up to us  No matter what happens in the Senate  it is up to us in 2020  This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness  to refuse and reject the cynicism  That is what this presidential election is about  It is what my campaign is about  Our opportunity in 2020  no matter what happens in Washington  as a country  to change the course of this nation for the better  46 Right now I think we're being offered a false choice  You either have to go all the way to the extreme or it's business as usual  Yes  we must deliver big ideas and yes  taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up  We can also be smart about the promises we're making  Make sure they're promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy  It's why  for example  I propose that we make college free for 80  of Americans  but it doesn't have to be free for the top  If you're in that top 10  how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on  that would make a big difference  Whether it's infrastructure  childcare  housing  health  On issue after issue  we've got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize  60 Well  I've made clear that this will be a topic of day one action  and this is not theoretical for me  I live in one of those river cities that you're talking about  Not only that  I live right by the river  My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years  Do the math on that so I know what's at stake and it's why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research on renewable energy  energy storage and carbon storage  But bigger than that  you have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this  36 I've seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change for as long as I've been alive  All these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050  and I think most or all of us have one  Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done  17 And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the auto worker down the block from me in South Bend  to a farmer a few minutes away  so that they understand that we are asking  recruiting them to be part of the solution  13 Not beating them over the head and telling them they are part of the problem  2 What we are seeing in the Middle East and around the world are the consequences of this president's failure  this president's refusal to lead  It's particularly disturbing in the case of Israel because he has infused domestic politics  making US foreign policy choices in order to effectively interfere in Israeli domestic politics  Acting as though that somehow makes him pro  Israel and pro  Jewish while welcoming white nationalists into The White House  31 But it's not only in the Middle East that we see the consequences of the disappearance of US leadership  We see among our allies and among our adversaries  case after case  where the world is making plans on what to do  ignoring the United States because we're no longer considered reliable  It's not just the mockery at a cocktail party on the sidelines of a conference  it's the looks on the faces of the leaders at the UN as they looked at the United States President with a mixture of contempt and pity  31 As an American  I never again want to see the American President looked at that way by the leaders of the world  The world needs America right now  but it can't be just any American  It has to be one that is actually living up to the values that make us who we are  Supporting peace  supporting democracy  supporting human rights and supporting stability around the world  26 I think that any tool ought to be on the table  especially diplomatic  economic and social tools like what you're describing  Look  for the president to let it be known that his silence  whether it's on the rounding up of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang  putting them into camps  or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy  For him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values  The reality is that there's a lot more to the relationship with China than who's selling more dishwashers  Yes  we need a much smarter trade policy  35 We also have to acknowledge what's going on over there  The use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship  That is going to require a stronger than ever response from the US in defense of democracy  But when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the President of the United States  what message is that sending to the Chinese Communist Party  The message I will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like Tienanmen Square when it comes to Hong Kong  they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically  36 I'm actually not worried about the president's bad sense of humor when it comes to being made fun of  I'm worried about the fact that he is echoing the vocabulary of dictators around the world  When the American president refers to unfavorable press coverage as the product of the enemy of the people  democracy around the world gets weaker  Freedom of the press  not just here at home but around the world  gets weaker  It's one more reminder of what is at stake  not just here at home  but for world history  in the imperative that we win this election  35 This is our chance  1 I can't help but feel that might've been directed at me and here's the thing  We're in the fight of our lives right now  Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing  not even foreign interference  to hold on to power  They've already put together more than  300 million  This is our chance  This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump  And we shouldn't try to do it with one hand tied behind our back  The way we're going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight  If that means that you're a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica com and chip in 10 bucks  that's great  And if you can drop  1 000 without blinking  that's great too  We need everybody's help in this fight  I'm not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump  We need Democrats who've been with us all along  yes  but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country  If you were Republican  disgusted with what's going on in your own party  we're not going to agree on everything  but we need you in this fight and I will welcome you to our side  70 You know  according to Forbes magazine  I am literally the only person on this stage who's not a millionaire or a billionaire  This is important  This is the problem with issuing purity tests  you cannot yourself pass  If I pledge never to be in the company of a progressive democratic donor  I couldn't be up here  Senator  your net worth is 100 times mine  Now  supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit  I know this isn't likely but stay with me  and decided to go on to Pete for america com and give the maximum allowable by law  2 800  Would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person  No  I would be glad to have that support  We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump  60 Hold on a sec  Sorry  as it went Senator  2 Senator  I've got to respond to this  3 First of all  if you can't say no to a donor  then you have no business running for office in the first place  But also  Senator  your presidential campaign right now as we speak  is funded in part by money you transferred  having raised it at those exact same big ticket fundraisers you now denounce  Did it corrupt you  Senator  Of course not  So  to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that president Obama went by  that Speaker Pelosi goes by  that you yourself went by until not long ago in order to build the democratic party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives  these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election upon us  43 Yes  and they should have a fast track to citizenship because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong and we have a moral obligation to make right what was broken  And on the larger issue of immigration  my understanding of this issue isn't theoretical  It's not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington  It begins with the fact that my household  my family came from abroad  My father immigrated to this country and became a U S  Citizen  It comes from the fact that I'm the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life  largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants  38  Largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants  And I've seen those same neighborhoods shut down  Families huddling in church  panicking just because of the rumor of an ice raid that does not make our country safe  11 Just to look into the eyes of an eight year old boy whose father was deported even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name and try to think of something to tell that boy because I couldn't tell him what he most wanted to hear  which is just that he was going to have his dad back  How can harming that young man possibly make America safer  23 When I am president  Based on those experiences  I will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values and that means not only ending these unspeakable frugal practices at the border  but finally and truly fixing the immigration system that has needed  a full overhaul since the 1980s  20 We cannot wait four years  10 years  We cannot wait anymore to do something about this  4 I support H R  40 which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations  but we shouldn't wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative  Remember we're not talking about a gift to anybody  We're talking about mending what was broken  We're talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African Americans  And just crossing out or racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver a quality harms compound just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time  So does the value of a dollar stolen and that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority owned businesses with investments in health equity  with investments in HBCUs and on the longer term a look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken  55 You know  sorry  0 You actually did denigrate my experience Senator and it was before the break and I was going to let it go cause we got bigger fish to fry here  But  you implied that my relation  7 You're right  and before the break you seemed to imply that my relationship to the First Amendment was a talking point  As if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the constitution than anybody else up here  Let me tell you about my relationship to the First Amendment  It is part of the Constitution that I raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life  That is my experience and it may not be the same as yours  but it counts  senator  it counts  33 I've got to respond to that  Senator I know that if you just go by vote totals  maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you  If you want to talk about the capacity to win  try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80  of the vote as a gay dude and Mike Pence's Indiana  31 I do think that if you're in that lucky top 10  I still wish you  well  don't get me wrong  I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition  Now we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that  But if you're not top 10  I think you're going to be for the most part  Okay  And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes  So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires  I just don't agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition  37 The Supreme court is very personal for me because my household  my marriage  exists by the grace of a single vote on that body  and yes  it is critical that we have justices who understand that American freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom  but that's not all  I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights  I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield  which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview  but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history  So that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up  54 We're going to leave one way or the other  The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly  And of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement  But the other day I was reunited with somebody that I served with over there and the thing we were  marveling at is how long it's been since we left  I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and we're still there  There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity  The exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in Syria  holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos  But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars  46 And I'm glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned  not only because of what she's talked about years ago  I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9 11 but right now  she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that  They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage  to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president  anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war  anytime we seek an authorization  it will have a three year sunset  So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it  it has to be brought to Congress  brought to the American people  and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote  49 Well  first of all  I love data and books  so I think we should all be excited about this  And come to think of it  I should probably send my book around more to  Look  I think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day  We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of The United States compared to what we've got  And we got to remember there  I don't know how many  now we're up to 25 something  have run for president in the democratic party  The moment we've got a nominee  the 24 who aren't that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does  Let's make sure there's not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes  51 So the nominee is going to have to do two things  defeat Donald Trump  and unite the country as president  It's a tall order  And in order to do it  we're going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today  That means building up a politics that is defined  not by who we exclude  not by who we reject  but by how many people we can call to this side  I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial  multi generational coalition and I'm seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before  but belong here now  because they're definitely not on board with what's going on in the Trump white house  I am asking you to join me  to vote for me to caucus for me and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion but by belonging  68 Well  the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics  and it is not a part of the campaign  but the president's conduct is  The impeachable conduct that we have seen  in the abuse of power that we're learning more about in the investigations  But just to be clear  the president's already confessed to it on television  but that's just part of what we've seen  Under normal circumstances  a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all  which was the president had to confess  in writing  in court  to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans  We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing  but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump Presidency comes to an end  one way or the other  50 I'm running to be the president for that day the sun comes up  and the Trump Presidency is behind us  which will be a tender moment in the life of this country  And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever  and while doing it  address big issues that didn't take a vacation for the impeachment process  or for the Trump Presidency as a whole  a climate approaching the point of no return  The fact that we've still got to act on healthcare  kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read  and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good  far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold onto what they've got  36 Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president  and will be at the heart of our campaign  4 Well  as President Obama commented recently  we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago  And to me  the extraordinary potential of the moment we're in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues  that didn't exist in the same way even a few years ago  Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense  like immigration  and guns  we have a majority to do the right thing  If we can galvanize  not polarize that majority  For example  on healthcare  31 The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare  is that that is something that as a governing strategy  we can unify the American people around  Creating a version of Medicare  making it available to anybody who wants it  but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not  And I believe that commanding people to accept that option  whether we wait three years as Senator Warren has proposed or whether you do it right out of the gate  is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very  very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver  42 Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump  I get that it's not traditional establishment Washington experience  but I would argue we need something very different right now  In order to defeat this president  we need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to  I don't talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them  I don't even golf  As a matter of fact  I never thought I'd be on a Forbes Magazine list  but they did one of all the candidates by wealth  and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage  I also wore the uniform of this country  and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office  in The Situation Room  And I know how to bring people together to get things done  50 I know that from the perspective of Washington  what goes on in my city might look small  but frankly where we live  the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small  The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small  and I believe we to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience  the experience on the ground  solving problems  working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government  Recognizing what is required of executive leadership  and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best run communities in the Heartland  before the other way around starts to happen  38  Communities in the Heartland before the other  0 We shouldn't have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn't have been started in the first place  I will support farmers  but not long ago I was in Boone  Iowa  a guy came up to me  he said   I got my Trump bailout check  but I would have rather spent that money on conservation   By the way  this isn't even making farmers whole  If you're in soybeans  for example  you're getting killed and it's not just what this president's done with the trade war and a lot of parts of the country  27 The worst thing is these so called small refinery waivers  which are killing those who were involved in ethanol  Look  I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers  He keeps asking them to take one for the team  but more and more I'm talking to people in rural America who see that they're not going to benefit from business as usual under this president  21 I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers  but we have to stand up for them not just with direct subsidies and support  but with making sure we do something about the consolidation  the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to  and American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change  23 I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big as symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country  And it's an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging their part of the problem  23 Yes  but we won't need them cause we're going to fix the trade war  3 We need to re prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular  It's not just how much  although we certainly need to look at the runaway in military spending  it's also where  Right now we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now  If we fall behind on artificial intelligence  the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turn into bigger targets  We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president  After all  he's relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall  There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future  54 My response is I completely agree  And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me  And before I share what's in my plans  let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important  As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income  for eight years I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries  but then compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory  I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded  marginalized and cast aside and oppressed in society  52 And I care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin  I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country  Turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate  And seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side  shoulder to shoulder  Making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago  lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day even if they are nothing like me in their experience  43 Well  we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century because this affects every other issue that we care about  Now  the House of Representatives passed a pro democracy anti corruption bill  which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell's hands in the United States Senate  We know that with the White House in the right hands  we can make  for example  election days a federal holiday  We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration  same day voter registration  making it easier for people to vote and in particular  recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins  53 Right now we have politicians picking out their voters rather than the other way around  That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name  14 While these process issues are not always fashionable  we must act to reform our democracy itself  including when it comes to choosing our presidency  What we do in  crosstalk 01 45 48  election  giving it to the person who got the most votes  13 Election  giving it to the person who got the most votes  0 First of all  Washington experience is not the only experience that matters  There's more than a hundred years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country  I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done  I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president  I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives  our homes  our families  our workplaces and our marriages  I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need  not just to go to Washington  but to change it before it is too late  43 I know that it's par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context  but that is outlandish even by the standards of today's politics  8 I was talking about U S   Mexico  cooperation  We've been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example  Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico  22 I'm talking about building up alliances  If your question is about experience  let's also talk about judgment  One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al Assad  I have in my experience  such as it is  whether you think it counts or not  since it wasn't accumulated in Washington  enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that  23 Like Donald Trump  who met with Kim  3  crosstalk 01 51 07  respond to this  This is a  crosstalk 01 51 09   1 Well  first of all  I want to remark that we're in the city of Atlanta  a city where a great local leader  Maynard Jackson  helped create the black middle class that Atlanta is known by  by ensuring that taxpayer dollars were spent in a way that reflected the need to expand opportunity to those who were excluded  Just as local leaders have shown great leadership  we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this  expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country  I'm not only running to defeat Donald Trump  I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office  to launch the era that must come after Trump  44 That era must be characterized not by exclusion  but by belonging  and so must our campaign  I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues we've been talking about tonight all along  moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition  and a lot of future former Republicans  who I know are watching this  disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country  I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create  I hope you go to PeteforAmerica com  join this effort and help us create a better era for the American people  beginning in November  2020  42 Well  it's a mistake on the part of Republicans who enabled a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share  Look  the President has left the Congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations  but actions that he has confessed to on television  It's also about the presidency itself because a president  10 years or 100 years from now  will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion  either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything  But everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency  Remember  one way or the other  this presidency is going to come to an end  I want you to picture what it's going to be like  what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president  56 It starts out feeling like a happy thought  This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over  but really think about where we'll be  vulnerable  even more torn apart by politics than we are right now  And these big issues  from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process  I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now  28 Well  we heard it tonight  A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer  This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular  Your signature Senator  is to have a plan for everything except this  no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in  And the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest  biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself  But the way to do it without a giant multi trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for All who want it  We take a version of Medicare  we let you access it if you want to  And if you prefer to stay on your private plan  you can do that too  That is what most Americans want  Medicare for all who want it  trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family  And it can be delivered without  crosstalk 00 23 00  61 I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for All who want it  which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place  allows you to get that healthcare  It's just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not  And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans  kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years  when we could achieve that same big bold goal  And once again  we're competing to be president for the day after Trump  Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now  After everything we've been through  after everything we are about to go through  this country will be even more divided  Why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all  53 This is exactly what I said  4 I'm all for a wealth tax  I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers  Let me tell you  though  how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live  Washington politicians  congressmen  and senators saying all the right things  offering the most elegant policy prescriptions  and nothing changes  I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad's Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school  I didn't know that wasn't every city until I went away to college  Now I drive my own Chevy  It's a Chevy Cruze  Used to be built right in Lordstown  which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers  But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place  It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything  and while he's unquestionably made it dramatically worse  this is time to realize that we're paying attention to the wrong things  We're paying attention  59  NAME  2 Well  respectfully  Congresswoman  I think that is dead wrong  The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence  it's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal  by this President  of American allies and American values  Look  I didn't think we should've gone to Iraq in the first place  I think we need to get out of Afghanistan  but it's also the case that a small number of specialized special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now  which is the beginning of a genocide  and the resurgence of ISIS  35 Meanwhile  soldiers in the field are reporting that  for the first time  they feel ashamed  ashamed of what their country has done  We saw the spectacle  the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms  asking what the hell happened to American leadership  And when I was deployed  I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word  and our allies knew it  and our enemies lose that  28 You take that away  you are taking away what makes America America  4 It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place  4 No  you can embrace  or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policy as you're doing  5 What we are doing  1 What we are doing  or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word  Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too  When I was deployed  not just the Afghan National Army Forces  but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U S  Forces  I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there  And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers  You take away  33   the honor of our soldiers  you might as well go after their body armor next  This President has betrayed American values  6   our credibility is in tatter  I will restore U S  credibility before it is finally too late  5 But this is really important  because what this President has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies  or sometimes allies too  Remember  the problem right now is not just with our competitors  In for example  a place like China  the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy  and don't get a peep of support from the President  It's not just the behavior of adversaries like Russia  but our one time allies like Saudi Arabia  which the CIA just concluded was responsible  as we all knew  for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist  and Turkey  which was an American ally  That's the point  We had leverage  but when we abandoned the international stage  when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation  the consequence is  43   the disappearance of U S  leadership from the world stage  and that makes this entire world a more dangerous place  4 Well  Congressman  you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets  If you can develop the plan further  I think we can have a debate about it  but we can't wait  People are dying in the streets right now  We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through  We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street  We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides  which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country  We cannot wait for purity tests  We have to just get something done  40 The problem isn't the polls  the problem is the policy  And I don't need lessons from you on courage  political or personal  Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done  Everyone on this stage recognizes  or at least I thought we did  that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this  the problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress  and we should be united in taking the fight to them  28 What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution  I'm glad you offered up  3   that analogy to healthcare because this is really important  We are at the cusp of building a new American majority  to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire  11   adult life  No  this is really important  okay  On guns  we are this close to an assault weapons ban  That would be huge  6   guns  We are this close to an assault weapons ban  That would be huge and we're going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it's   Hell  yes  we're going to take your guns   We have an opportunity to deliver  8   healthcare to everybody  and someone on this stage was saying   It doesn't count   4 That's right  When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate  Now I'm not talking about packing the Court just with people who agree with me  although I certainly will appoint people who share my values  For example the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right  What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the Court  We can't go on like this  where every single time there is a vacancy we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next  31 Now one way to fix this would be to have a 15 member Court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10  Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment  But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis  There are other reforms that we could consider  From term limits  don't forget justices used to just retire like everybody else  to a rotation off the appellate bench  28 I'm not wedded to a particular solution but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one  5   that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court because we can't go on like this  5 If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this I could pay for college for everybody  We need to move passed what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive  12 We're being offered a false choice  I don't agree with the Vice President that Trump is an aberration  I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal because here in the industrial Midwest  definitely where I live  normal didn't work  That's part of how we got here  That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place  19 But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat  Yes we have to fight  Absolutely we have to fight for the big changes at hand  but it's going to take more than fighting  10 Once again I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president  Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime  Medicare for all who want it  actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s  an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal  making college free for low and middle income students  Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn't count unless we go even further  Free college for low and middle income students isn't good enough unless we're also paying for the children of billionaires  Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings  35 We have an opportunity to do the biggest things  2   we've done in my lifetime  1 But there's a missing piece  2 Well  I think about the friendships that I formed in the military  People who were radically different from me  different generation  different race  definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives  When they got into my vehicle  and when we went outside the wire  they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend  They didn't care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not  We just learned to trust each other  In fact  the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important  I guess I'll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you could go to peteforamerica com and read all about it  44 It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country because I think that's what friendship and that's what service can create and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair  I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country  The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president  It is the unification of the American people and I'm asking for your vote to be that president when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency  pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future  45 Right now  we can act  3 It's original  I'll give you that  The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we've ever seen  As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink  as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan  I know what's at stake in our national leadership  We keep sending politicians to Washington  asking them to fight for us  but then when they get there  they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us  Good politics is supposed to be not about the day to day fights of the politicians  but about the day to day lives of Americans  39 We just marked the anniversary of 9 11  All day today  I've been thinking about September 12th  The way it felt when  for a moment  we came together as a country  Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity  Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time  but big enough  as well  that they could unify the American people  That's what presidential leadership can do  That's what the Presidency is for  and that is why I'm asking for your vote  33 The problem  Senator Sanders  with that damn bill that you wrote  and that Senator Warren backed  6   with that damn bill that you wrote  and that Senator Warren backs  is that it doesn't trust the American people  I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you  Not  My way or the highway   Now look  I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA  I propose Medicare for all who want it  We take a version of Medicare  we make it available for the American people  and if we're right as progressives that that public alternative is better  then the American people will figure that out for themselves  I trust the American people to make the right choice for them  whey don't you  32 This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable  because this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington  scoring points against each other  poking at each other  and telling each other that  Your plan  my plan   Look  we all  14 I believe what's deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president  and we have a change all of that  Look  systemic racism preceded this president  and even when we defeat him it will be with us  That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it  It's not enough to just take a racist policy  replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own  Harms' compound in the same way that a dollar saved compound  so does a dollar stolen  and we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts in two different countries  I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas  46 Marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshal Plan that rebuilt Europe  but this time a Douglas Plan that we invest right here at home  to make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the over incarceration of black Americans  but also black solutions  Entrepreneurship  raising to 25  the target for the federal government to do business with minority owned businesses  Investing in HPCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs  We can and must do that  but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other  that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced autoworker  because where I come from a lot of times that displaced autoworker is a single black mother of three  We've got to say that and bring people together  44 Anyone who supports this is supporting racism   foreign language 00 22 43   The only people though who actually buy into this president's hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don't know any  We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform  In my community  a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual  a beloved local individual who was deported when he went in to ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out because they never thought it would happen to him  In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa  I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow  And it's why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America  includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs  but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city  55 The only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration  It's one of the reasons we acted  not waiting for Washington to create city issued municipal IDs  So that people regardless of immigration status in our city  had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification  We have an opportunity to actually get something done  21 But we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines  often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s  We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities  but our values  Values of welcome  values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws  28 Well  the president clearly has no strategy  You know  when I first got into this race  I remember president Trump scoffed and said he'd like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping  I'd like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping  13 Is it just me or was that supposed to happen in like April  It's one more example of a commitment not made  When that happens on the international stage  people take note  not just our competitors  our adversaries  but also our allies  Take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans  And when that happens  there are serious consequences  24 We saw it at the G7  the leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world  climate change  and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been  The problem is this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever  whether it's in Hong Kong where those protestors for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around  The world needs America  but it can't be just any America   crosstalk 00 02 52   33 I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage  but it's not about the tariffs  Look what's going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of of tariffs  when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else  and there's a lack of a bigger strategy  19 You know I served under General Dunford  way under General Dunford in Afghanistan  And today  September 12th  2019 means that today you could be 18 years old  old enough to serve  and have not been alive on 9 11  We have got to put an end to endless war  And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be  30   that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland  and that does not require an open ended commitment of ground troops  7 Let me say something else  because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan   from Afghanistan  it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place  And so when I am president  an authorization for the use of military force will have a built in three year sunset  Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization  Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas  the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there  38 By the way  we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props  or worse  tools for his own enrichment  We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels  I'll tell you  as a military officer  the very first thing that goes through your mind the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you were responsible for in uniform is   Do not let these men and women down   This president is doing exactly that  I will not  30 Step one is appoint a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education  I believe in public education  In order to strengthen it some things are very complex  for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips but we got to teach more to do with critical thinking  and social and emotional learning  Some of it is extremely simple  we've just got to pay teachers more  We've got to lift up the teaching profession  31 I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan  They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher  They kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college  She took the exam to try to become a teacher  in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well  She came up just short  You know what she did  Since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher  She had a fallback plan  She became a doctor  That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession  33 If we want to get the results that we expect for our children we have to support and compensate the teaching profession  Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors  12 As a military officer serving under   Don't Ask  Don't Tell   and as an elected official in the State of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor  at a certain point when it came to professional setbacks  I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback  I came back from deployment and realized that you only get to live one life  and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer  So  I just came out  I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be  especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially Conservative community  52 What happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them  they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80  of the vote  What I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning  I think that's what we need in the presidency right now  We have to know what we are about  29 This election is not about any of us up here  It is not about this President  even though it's hard to talk of anything else some days  It's about the people who trust us with their lives  A kid wondering if we're actually going to make their schools safe when they've learned active shooter drills before they've learned to read  a generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change  If we hold to that  then it doesn't matter what happens to each of us professionally  Together we will win a better era for our country  31 I'm running for president because our country is running out of time  It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency  Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance as the Oval Office in the first place  It doesn't happen unless America is already in a crisis  19 An economy that's not working for everyone  endless war  climate change  We have lived this  In my industrial Midwestern hometown  my generation has lived this as long as we have been alive  And it's only accelerated  Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate  20 By 2030 the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a woman's right to choose may not even exist  We're not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments  policies  and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive  19 We've got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different  This is our shot  That is why I'm running for president  9 So  we don't have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options  We can put it to the test  That's the concept of my Medicare for All who want to proposal  That way  if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there  we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off   crosstalk 00 19 28  32 I think you can buy into it  That's the idea of Medicare for All who want it  4 Look  this is a distinction without a difference whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums  Look  In this country  if you have health coverage  If you don't have health coverage  you're paying too much for care  And if you do have health coverage  you're paying too much for the care   crosstalk 00 19 56  12 It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say  Look  if it's true that if we embrace a far left agenda  they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists  If we embrace a conservative agenda  you know what they're going to do  They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists  So  let's just stand up for the right policy  go out there and defend it  That's the policy I'm putting forward  not because I think it's the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there  because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother in law who is here whose life was saved by the ACA  but who was still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her health   crosstalk 00 28 04  35 When I'm President  illegally crossing the border will still be illegal  We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law  but we've got a crisis on our hands  And it's not just a crisis of immigration  It's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border  It is a stain on the United States of America  25 Americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly  we've been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime  Protections for dreamers  making sure that that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented  cleaning up lawful immigration  We know what to do  We know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws  The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington  and now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement  but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement  That will end on my wall  33 So  in my view  if fraud is involved  then that's suitable for the criminal statute  If not  then it should be handled under civil law  These show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being   crosstalk 00 34 32  11 We appreciate that  1 Well  this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community  too  far too many times  That's the worst part of being Mayor  getting the phone call  consoling grieving parents  We have a mass shootings worth of killings everyday in this country  16 What we're doing hasn't worked  because we haven't had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want  90  of Republicans want universal background checks  not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and flag mental health risks  And an end to assault weapons  things like what I carried overseas in uniform  that have no business in American neighborhoods in peacetime  let alone anywhere near a school  28 I was at an event a few days ago  and a 13 year old asked me what we were going to do about school safety  and then began shaking  and then began crying  And we could talk about these policies  but we already know the policies  The only thing I could think of looking into the eyes of this child is  we're supposed to be dealing with this so you don't have to  High school is hard enough without having to worry about whether you're going to get shot  25 And when 90  of Americans to happen  3   and Washington can't deliver  1   we can't expect the same  0 This is the exact same conversation we've been having since I was in high school  I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened  I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings  We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country  We dare not allow there to be a third  Something is broken  If it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do  They won't prevent every incident  they won't save every life  but we know what to do and it has not happened  32 It's still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years  Of course we need to get money of out politics  but when I propose the actual structural Democratic reforms that might make a difference  end the Electoral College  amend the Constitution if necessary to clear up Citizens United  have D C  actually be a state and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform  people look at me funny  as if this country were incapable of structural reform  25 Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without Constitutional action  This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that  10 And you're telling me we can't reform our Democracy in our time  2 We have to or we'll be having the same argument 20 years from now  3 We have all put out highly similar visions on climate  It is all theoretical  We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency  if and only if we beat Donald Trump  Nominate me and you get to see the President of the United States stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve  Nominate me and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the President of the United States thinks you're a sucker  When the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing or the cost of education  40   or the cost of prescription drugs  And he has done nothing about it except a tax cut for the corporations  4 As an urban mayor serving a diverse community  the racial divide lives within me  I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch  But in our city we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing  and so we directed it to a historically under invested African American neighborhood  Right now  in the wake of a police involved shooting  our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters  I proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally  because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action  Systemic racism has touched every part of American life  from housing to health to home ownership  If you walk into an emergency room and you are black  your reports of pain will be taken less seriously  If you apply for a job and you are black  you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume  It's why I've proposed that we do everything from investing in historically redlined neighborhoods  72   To build black wealth in home ownership  2 To supporting entrepreneurship for black Americans  2   rid of loans  1 We will withdraw  We have to  2 Yes  Look  around the world we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe  but I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan when I thought I was turning out the lights years ago  14 Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan  I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with  somebody that I knew  a friend  roommate  colleague  13 We're pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9 11  I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization as well as the president  and we need to talk not only about the need for a president committed to ending endless war  but the fact that Congress has been asleep at the switch  23 And on my watch  I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three year sunset and have to be renewed because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve  members of Congress ought to have to summon  12   the courage to vote on whether they ought to  crosstalk 00 18 10   2 I don't care how old you are  I care about your vision  But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world  Leaders like the  I actually think it's good that the prime minister of New Zealand has gotten a lot of attention in Democratic debates  She's masterful  She is younger than I would be when I take office  20 This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following  but only if it's actually backed by the right vision  And we can have great presidents at any age  What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win  We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal  Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work  We have to be ready to take on this president  22 And by the way  something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight  take on his enablers in Congress  You know  when David Duke  When David Duke ran for Congress  ran for governor  the Republican Party 20 years ago ran away from him  Today  they are supporting naked racism in the White House who were at best silent about it  20 And if you were watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress  consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life  the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president  you found the courage to stand up to him or you continue to put party over country  26 There's good news and bad news  I'm going to start with the bad news  Our country's in trouble  GPD is going up  and life expectancy is going down  Think about what that means  It's only getting tougher  By 2030  we will have passed the point of no return on climate  There could be 130 million more guns on our streets  I'll be in my 40s then  If you have kids  think about how old they will be then  24 Here's the good news  It's not too late  We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time  just before we ran out of time in 2020  we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us  to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement  that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats  26 We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action and win  not only defeat this President but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office  Join me and let's make it happen  21 Beunas noches   foreign language 00 10 03   2 Sure  College affordability is personal for us  Chasten and I have six figure student debt  6 I believe in reducing student debt  It's logical to me that if you can refinance your house  you ought to be able to refinance your student debt  I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier  16 I just don't believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize  even the children of billionaires  I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition  and while I want tuition cost to go down  I don't think we can buy down every last penny for them  16 Now  there's something else that doesn't get talked about in the college affordability debate  Yes  it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college  It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college  You should be able to live well  afford rent  be generous to your church and little league  whether you went to college or not  That's one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least  15 an hour  23 Yo  we've taught  Look  everybody who says Medicare for All  every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you're actually supposed to get from here to there  13 And here's how I would do it  It's very similar  I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It  You take something like Medicare  a flavor of that  and you make it available on the exchanges  People can buy in  and then people like us are right that that will not only a more inclusive plan  but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there  then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment  22 But let's remember  even in countries that have outright socialized medicine like England  even there  there's still a private sector  That's fine  it's just that for our primary care we can't be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system  This is one is very personal for me  I started out this year dealing with the terminal illness of my father  I make decisions for a living  20 Nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced  But the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was going to bankrupt our family  because of Medicare  11 I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right  not live in  crosstalk 00 20 49   5 Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier  Remember  we're talking about something people are given a chance to buy into  In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community  who pay  They pay sales taxes  they pay property taxes directly or indirectly  This is not about a handout  This is an insurance program  22 And we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare  But of course the real problem is  we should have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship  It makes no sense  The American people agree on what to do  This is the crazy thing  if leadership consists of forming a consensus around a device of issue  This White House has divided us around a consensus issue  29 The American people want a pathway to citizenship  they wanted protections for Dreamers  we need to clean up the lawful immigration system  like how my father immigrated to this country  and as part of a comprise  we can do whatever common sense measures are needed at the border  12 But Washington can't deliver on something the American people want  What does that tell you about the system we're living in  It tells you  7 It needs profound structural reform  3 Let's remember that's not just a theoretical exercise  That criminalization  that is the basis for family separation  You do away with that  it's no longer possible  Of course  it wouldn't be possible anyway in my presidency  because it is dead wrong  16 We've got to talk about one other thing  because the Republican party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion  Now  our party doesn't talk about that as much  largely for a very good reason  which was we are committed to the separation of church and state  and we stand for people of any religion  and people of no religion  17 But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it  And for a party that associates itself with Christianity  to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents  that God would condone putting children in cages  has lost all claim to ever use religious language again  20 First of all  we've got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one  This is not something to dismiss or wave away  And if you look at what China is doing  they're using technology for the perfection of dictatorship  But their fundamental economic model isn't going to change because of some tariffs  18 I live in the industrial Midwest  Folks who aren't in the shadow of a factory  or somewhere near a soy field where I live  And manufacturers  and especially soy farmers  are hurting  Tariffs are taxes  and Americans are going to pay on average 800 dollars more a year  because of these tariffs  18 Meanwhile  China is investing  so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence  And this President is fixated on the kind of relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers  We've got a much bigger issue on our hands  14 But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours  because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now  because of our internal divisions  the biggest thing we've got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness  14 If we disinvest in our own infrastructure  education  we are never going to be able to compete  And if we really want to be an alternative  a democratic alternative  we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values at home and around the world  13 Because I couldn't get it done  My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting  A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer  I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back  The officer says he was attacked with a knife but he didn't have his body camera on  It's a mess  We're hurting  21 I could walk you through all of the things we have done as a community  all of the steps that we took from bias training to deescalation but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan  When I look into his mother's eyes I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back  20 This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country  Until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism  whatever this particular incident teaches us  we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there's a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time  Not just from what's happened in the past but from what's happening around the country in the present  23 It threatens the wellbeing of every community  I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle  when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing  A feeling not of fear but of safety  16 I am determined to bring that day about  2 I've got to respond to that  Look  we've taken so many steps towards police accountability  The FOP just denounced me for too much accountability  We're obviously not there yet  I accept responsibility for that because I am in charge  12 Under Indiana law  this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved  5 Well  the reality is  we need to begin adapting right away  but we also can't skip a beat on preventing climate change from getting even worse  It's why we need aggressive and ambitious measures  It's why we need to do a carbon tax and dividend  but I would propose we do it in a way that is rebated out to the American people in a progressive fashion so that most Americans are made more than whole  21 This isn't theoretical for us in south Indiana  Parts of California on fire  right here in Florida they're talking about sea level rise  Well  in Indiana  I had to activate the Emergency Operations Center of our city twice in less than two years  First time was a 1 000 year flood  and the next time was a 500 year flood  This is not just happening on the Arctic ice caps  This is happening in the middle of the country and we've got to be dramatically more aggressive moving forward  26 Now here's what very few people talk about  First of all  rural American can be part of the solution instead of being told they're part of the problem  With the right kind of soil management and other kind of investments  rural America could be a huge part of how we get this done  Secondly  we got to look to the leadership of local communities  Those networks of mayors  18 Of cities from around the world who  1 Have come together  not even waiting for our national governments to catch up  We should have a Pittsburgh Summit where we bring them together as well as rejoining the Paris  7 Here's the solution  Pass the torch  Pass the torch to the generation that's going to feel the effects of climate change  4 We got to fix our democracy before it's too late  Get that right  climate  immigration  taxes  and every other issue gets better  7 Yes  of course  because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons  Look  every part of my life experience informs this  Being the Mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence  we lose as many as were lost at Parkland every two or three years in my city alone  This is tearing communities apart  22 If more guns made us safer  we'd be the safest country on earth  It doesn't work that way  Common sense measures like universal background checks can't seem to get delivered by Washington  even when most Republicans  let alone most Americans  agree it's the right thing to do  As somebody who trained on weapons of war  I can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peace time  ever  29 We have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off worse between now and then  What we know is that our relationship with the entire world needs to change  and it starts by modeling American values at home  12 Nothing about politics is theoretical for me  I've had the experience of writing a letter to my family  putting it in an envelope marked  just in case   and leaving it where they would know where to find it in case I didn't come back from Afghanistan  I've experience with being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U S  Supreme Court  I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below  20 000 when I took office into a brighter future  I'm running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go  When I get to the current age of the current president in the year 2055  I want to be able to look back on these years and say   My generation delivered climate solutions  racial equality  and an end to endless war   Help me deliver that new generation to Washington before it's too late  50 
Elizabeth Warren,Look  the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party and progressive ideas are popular ideas  Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so  But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things  but I think I would make a better president than Bernie  And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen  Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street  In 2008  we both got our chance  but I dug in  I fought the big banks  I built the coalitions and I won  Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare  but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there  doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it  60 I dug in  I did the work and then Bernie's team trashed me for it  We need a president who is going to dig in  do the hard work and actually get it done  Progressive's have got one shot and we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done  19 I mean that Mayor Bloomberg   Let's think of it this way  We're here in Charleston  and you know who's going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump  He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy  Senator Lindsey Graham  Who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re election last time  It was Mayor Bloomberg  20 And that's not the only right wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded  In 2016  he dumped  12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re elect an anti choice  right wing Republican senator  And I just want to say  the woman challenger was terrific  She lost by a single point  In 2012  he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger  That was me  It didn't work  but he tried hard  38 I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has  The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him  He has not earned their trust  I will  And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage  25 I was mentioned in this  0 I'd like to respond  1 He called me out by name in this  0   and referred to what I talk about as a  sideshow   This is personal for me  When I was 21 years old  I got my first job as a special education teacher  I loved that job  And by the end of the first year  I was visibly pregnant  The principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else  Pregnancy discrimination  You bet  But I was 21 years old  I didn't have a union to protect me  and I didn't have any federal law on my side  So I packed up my stuff  and I went home  At least I didn't have a boss who said to me   Kill it   the way that Mayor Bloomberg  39   is alleged to have said  0   to one of his pregnant employees  People want a chance  5 People want a chance  1   to hear from the women who have worked for Mayor Bloomberg  1 Then let us have   the women have an opportunity to speak  The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination  They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak  If he says there is nothing to hide here  then sign a blanket release  and let those women speak out  23   so that they can tell their stories  0   the way I can tell my story without  2   having the fear  0   that they're going to be sued by a billionaire  1 Oh  I'll be clear  0 I'll tell you exactly what I want you to do  1 No  I'm sorry  Mr  Mayor  0   you did not do what I asked  1 Yes  0 Her own words  1 This is  1 Look  0 What I asked the Mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims  5 Who have discrimination claims  0   against the Mayor  4 Okay  0 That is the problem  And that is that a progressive agenda is popular  Mayor Bloomberg  And for everyone on this stage  we talk about how to build a future  That's what matters  I talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on healthcare  It's why I also have a way to pay for healthcare that doesn't raise taxes on middle class families  But it's so much more than that  As Democrats  we need to speak to the future we can build together  We need to speak to the prosperity we can build together  How about a wealth tax in America  Because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one 10th of 1   we have a chance to invest in universal childcare for every one of our babies  To really level the playing field  Put  50 billion into historically black colleges and universities  And start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans  We need to talk about our aspirations  our hopes  This is a moment to choose hope over fear  67 This is our moment  1 Yes  this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it's going to take to get something done  I've been in the Senate when I've seen gun safety legislation introduced  get a majority  and then doesn't pass because of the filibuster  Understand this  the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry  It gives a veto to the oil industry  It's going to give a veto on immigration  Until we're willing to dig in and say that if Mitch McConnell is going to do to the next Democratic president what he did to President Obama  and that is try to block every single thing he does  that we are willing to roll back the filibuster  go with a majority vote  and do what needs to be done for the American people  48 Understand this  many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster  7 Until we're ready to do that  we can't make real change  1 So this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself  And I'm going to start with my Secretary of Education  My Secretary of Education will be someone who has taught in public school  My Secretary of Education will was someone who believes in public education  and my Secretary of Education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools  One more thing  My Secretary of Education will believe that it is time to get rid of high stakes testing  We need to support our children  But look  we want to build a future in this country  We build a future by investing in our children  I've got a plan to put 800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools  45 Education is not free  1   to our public schools  Education is not free  We must invest in the future of our children  3 One way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt  1 People across this country are being crushed by student loan debt  This is an issue we need to talk about  5 This is a point where we need to talk about race though  It is not enough to talk about housing neutrally  and just be race blind  It is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against African Americans having an opportunity to buy homes  That's redlining  While Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African Americans and on Latinos  in fact  I was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages  I have a housing plan  and what it has in it specifically is a piece to deal with the effects of redlining  We can no longer pretend that everything is race neutral  We have got to address  race consciously  what's happening in this  56 I do  1 Look  a president's first job is to keep America safe  and an important part of that is to have a strong military  All three of my brothers served in the military  and I understand how much the military sacrifices  how much their families sacrifice  and how much they are willing to put on the line  That means that we have a sacred responsibility to them  and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily  34 We are not winning in Afghanistan  We are not winning in the Middle East  What we need to do is  we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox  We need a strong military  We also need a strong State Department  Those are our eyes and ears on the ground  They are our front lines in diplomacy  We need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy  and we need strong alliances  We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm  and we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators  We need not to cut and run on our allies  We need an approach that keeps us safe by using  45  NAME  2 We have to be able to trust our president  because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that  And that's one the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes  We know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time  and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes  He plans to release them after Super Tuesday  It is not enough to be able to say   Just trust me on this   We have a president who said he was going to  37  release his taxes after the election  2  NAME  2 No  Actually  1 Actually  he put the tax returns  0 Yeah  1 Look  the way we have to think about this is I think we have to start with the values  and what has to be protected here  Israelis have a right to security  and the Palestinians have a right to be treated with dignity and to have self determination  That is a two state solution  but it's not up to us to determine what the terms of a two state solution are  We want to be a good ally to everyone in the region  The best way to do that is to encourage the parties to get to the negotiating table themselves  Donald Trump's big mistake is he keeps putting a thumb on the scale on just one side  And that moves the parties further away from working out their own solution here  We need to be an ally  by supporting them to come to negotiate to find a lasting peace  48 It is not ours to do  2 It is not ours to do  We should let the parties determine the capitals themselves  9 I'm sorry  1 Look  I think that what we've got to do is we have to provide humanitarian relief  We need to work with our allies on this  but this is not a moment for military intervention  We have got to use our military  only when we see a military problem that can be solved militarily  We cannot send our military in unless we have a plan to get them out  So for me  this is about working with our allies  It is about standing with the people  who are under enormous pressure right now  This is recognizing what Donald Trump has put us in  in a terrible box around the world  But the solution is not to use our military  The solution is to use the other tools here  44 Well  I suppose one misconception is that I don't eat very much  In fact  I eat all the time  because I get teased about this  Look  I never was supposed to be on a stage like this and the misconception is that I thought I should be president of the United States  No  I got into this because I am a fighter  My motto ties in directly to this  It's Matthew 25 and that is in as much as she hath done it into one of these  the least of thy brethren  ye have done it unto me  For me  this is about how we treat other people and how we lift them up  That is why I am in this fight  That is why I am running to be president and it is why I will be an effective president  51 Thank you  Mayor Bloomberg  5 So I'd like  1 I'd like to talk about who we're running against  A billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians  And no  I'm not talking about Donald Trump  I'm talking about mayor Bloomberg  Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns  of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop and frisk  Look  I'll support whoever the democratic nominee is  but understand this  Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another  This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt  It is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them  That is why I am in this race and that is how I will beat Donald Trump  60 Look  I have said many times before  we are all responsible for our supporters  And we need to step up  that's what leadership is all about  But the way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock solid values and who actually gets something done  When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008  I was right here in Las Vegas  literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families  39 That's when I met Mr  Estrada  one of your neighbors  He came in to testify and he said he thought he'd done everything right with Wells Fargo  But what had happened  They took away his house in a matter of weeks  This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary schools  that they might be living out of their van  I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again  Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency  They lost and I won  We need a candidate with unshakeable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people  That's why I'm in this race  45 And that's how I'll beat Donald Trump  1 So I want to be clear  I've been to the Culinary Unions' healthcare facilities  they're terrific  You don't want to shut them down  you want to expand them  You want to see them all across Nevada and all across this country  But we need to get everybody's healthcare plan out here  Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants  to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their healthcare  It's not a plan  it's a PowerPoint  And Amy's plan is even less  it's like a Post it Note  insert plan here  Bernie has started very much  has a good start  46 But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help  instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work  And then his own advisor's say   Eh  probably won't happen anyway   Look  healthcare is a crisis in this country  My approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can  And if we don't get it all the first time  take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more  41 People need our help on this  1 Can I respond to that   crosstalk 00 20 20  0 Can I just respond to these two  0 Okay  1 So I actually  1 So I actually took a look at the plans that are posted  Mayor Buttigieg  there are four expenses that families pay  right  Premiums  deductibles  copays  and uncovered medical expenses  Mayor Buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums  17 And that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs  Amy  I looked online at your plan  It's two paragraphs  Families are suffering and they need a plan  13 You can't simply stand here and trash an idea to give healthcare coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own  And if you're not going to own up to the fact either that you don't have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without healthcare coverage  full coverage  then you need to say so  I just want to stay on this  crosstalk 00 25 01  was in Reno when I met a man who said he had diabetes  He gets his insulin through the VA  but his sister and his daughter also have diabetes  No way to pay for their insulin  Three human beings right here in Nevada who are struggling  They share one insulin prescription  This should not happen  crosstalk 00 25 24  44 I do think that this really is about leadership and accountability  When the mayor says that he apologized  listen very closely to the apology  The language he used is about stop and frisk  It's about how it turned out  Now this isn't about how it turned out  This is about what it was designed to do to begin with  It targeted communities of color  it targeted black and brown men from the beginning  And if you want to issue a real apology  then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance day by day by day of admitting what was happening  Even as people protested in your own street  shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives  You need a different apology  55 10 weeks ago  crosstalk 00 39 53  over time and get it done  9 Yes  I have  I hope you've heard what his defense was   I've been nice to some women   That just doesn't cut it  The mayor has to stand on his record  And what we need to know is exactly what's lurking out there  He has gotten some number of women   dozens  Who knows   to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace  So Mr  Mayor  are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story  44 How many is that  1 How many is that  2 So wait  When you say a   I just want to be clear  Some is how many  And when you say they signed them and they wanted them  if they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they alleged  that's now okay with you  You're releasing them on television tonight  22 Is that right  0 No  0 I'm sorry  No  the question is  are the women  2   bound by being muzzled by you  And you could release them from that immediately  Because understand  this is not just a question of the mayor's character  This is also a question about electability  We are not going to be Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip  drip  drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against  That's not what we do as Democrats  30   and discriminated against  That's not what we do as Democrats  0 Can I just defend Senator Klobuchar for a minute  This is not right  I understand that she forgot a name  It happens  It happens to everybody on this stage  Look  you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico  have at it  and if you get it wrong  man  you ought to be held accountable for that  You want to ask about the economy and you get it wrong  you ought to be held accountable  You want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong  you ought to be held accountable  But let's just be clear  missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what's going on  And I just think this is unfair   crosstalk 00 06 42   46 Fair enough  0 So look  I think we should stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and all offshore drilling  If we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that we've got to have access to  then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries  but in a way that is sustainable for the environment  We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who don't care about our environment and are not making it better  Look  I'm going to say something that is really controversial in Washington  but I think I'm safe to say this here in Nevada  I believe in science and I believe that the way we're going to deal with this problem  is that we are going to increase by 10 fold our investment in science  51 There's an upcoming  27 trillion market worldwide for green and much of what is needed has not yet been invented  My proposal is let's invent it here in the United States and then say we invent in the U S   you've got to build it in the U S  That's a million new manufacturing  21 Yes  we can have a Green New Deal and create jobs  We need people in infrastructure who will help build  We have manufacturing  10 Yes  those jobs are for tomorrow  Those are the ones we need to be working on to harden our infrastructure right now  But listen to Senator Klobuchar's point  She says we have to think smaller in order to get it passed  I don't think that's the right approach here  Why can't we get anything passed in Washington on climate  Everyone understands the urgency  but we've got two problems  The first is corruption  an industry that makes its money felt all through Washington  The first thing I want to do in Washington is pass my anti corruption bill so that we can start making the changes we need to make on climate  And the second is the filibuster  If you're not willing to roll back the filibuster  then you're giving the fossil fuel industry a veto over all of the work that we need to do  48 Yes  I want to make sure that the question of environmental justice gets more than a glancing blow in this debate  because for generations now in this country  toxic waste dumps  polluting factories have been located in or near communities of color over and over and over  And the consequences are felt in the health of young African American babies  It's felt in the health of seniors  people with compromised immune systems  30 It's also felt economically  Who wants to move into an area where the air smells bad or you can't drink the water  I have a commitment of  1 trillion to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on communities of color for generations now  We have to own up to our responsibility  We cannot simply talk about climate change in big global terms  We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged  29 We have an entrepreneurship gap in America  And that is a gap between white entrepreneurs and black and Latino entrepreneurs  And the principle reason for this is they don't have the money for equity to get the businesses started  It's about a  7 billion gap  We want to have real entrepreneurship and a level playing field  I have a plan to put the  7 billion in to have the fund managed by the people who are routinely cut out  It can't just be about taxes  36 We need to make an investment to level the playing field  And in the black  crosstalk 00 06 06   4 So let me make a proposal that will work  that has not only support from a majority of Democrats  but also from a majority of the independents and a majority of Republicans  And that is a two cent wealth tax on all fortunes above  50 million  You hit a billion  you've got to pay a few pennies more  This is a tax on the top 1 10th of 1  in America  And it permits us to start to restructure our economy  It means we can afford universal childcare for every baby in this country  age zero to five  It means we can have universal pre K for every child in America  It means we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher and stop exploiting the black and brown women who do this work  It means we can put  800 billion into our public schools  quadruple funding for Title One schools  57 And as a former special education teacher  we could fully fund IDEA so children with disabilities would get the full education they need  We can do college  We can put  50 billion dollars into our historically black colleges and universities  And we could cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans  That's something a majority of Americans support  a two cent wealth tax  It is a question of values  Do we want to invest in Mr  Bloomberg or do we want to invest in an entire generation  33  inaudible 00 17 17   1 Joe  can we talk  0 Can we go back to one thing  0 Understanding  1 Could I  crosstalk 00 20 49   1 Yes  because I am  1 Yes  because I am  Look  Democrats want to beat Donald Trump  but they are worried  They are worried about gambling on a narrow vision that doesn't address the fears of millions of Americans across this country who see real problems and want real change  They are worried about gambling on a revolution that won't bring along a majority of this country  Amy and Joe's hearts are in the right place  but we can't be so eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell that we forget how to fight the Republicans  39 Mayor Buttigieg has been taking money from big donors and changing his positions  7 So it makes it unclear what it is he stands for other than his own advancement  4 May I respond  0 Can I respond to the Vice President  please  0 He was identifying me specifically in that  2 And so no  the point is different  Here's what happened  According to the New York Times  the last time that Mitch McConnell was on the ballot  the Vice President stood in the Oval Office and said   I hope that Mitch gets re elected so I can keep working with him   16 Well  Mitch did get did cap re elected  He did not have an epiphany  Instead  he blocked really everything that Barack Obama tried to pass  10 He stole a Supreme court seat  2   From the Democrats  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  4 But a convention working its will means that people have the delegates that are pledged to them and they keep those delegates until  6   you come to the convention  1 All of the people  2 I grew up fighting  I grew up out in Oklahoma and I learned it probably from my mother  I watched when my daddy had a heart attack and didn't have any money coming in  When our car was lost and when we were on the edge of losing our home  I watched my mother fight to save our family  I grew up fighting to save our family  my family  I eventually made it through school and spent my life as a teacher  Looking into why it is that so many families across this country are struggling and why it gets worse year  after year  after year  34 I  for years  have fought for unions  To say the way we're going to restructure this economy is we're going to make it easier to join a union and get more power into unions  To fight for students who have been cut out of opportunity over and over because of the rising cost of an education  19 Look  for me  I am   Of all the people on this stage I've been a politician the shortest time but I've been the one out fighting for families the longest time  I promise you this  give me a chance  I'll go to The White House and I'll fight for your family  22 Oh  Bernie and I have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on  But there's fundamental question about how we bring our party together  We have to think about it in new ways  People across this country  whether they're Democrats  independents  or Republicans  understand that we've got a government right now that works great for those at the top  Works great for giant drug companies  just not for people trying to get a prescription filled  Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere  just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us  When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and it's not working so great for everyone else  that is corruption  pure and simple  and we need to call it out for what it is  Corruption  and that's what we can run on  We bring our party together  57 It's an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption  We're the Democrats  we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that  They hate the corruption as well  My anti corruption plan  good for Republicans and Democrats  That's not only how we bring our party together  That's how we're going to win in November  27 So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is  36 million Americans last year couldn't afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance  I want everyone in here to think about what that means  They were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor  a doctor looked at it and says that's serious enough to write a prescription  They walked out and then said  it's either that or groceries  It's that or pay them rent on time  We have got to change our healthcare system  The way  no audio or video 00 18 34  Help to the most people as quickly as we can  How about we start with what a president can do  I love saying this  all by herself  On day one  I will defend the Affordable Care Act and I will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV  AIDS  drugs and EpiPens  57 We can start making healthcare better for Americans from the beginning  but we have to agree to do that  We are the Democrats  we are on the side of expanding healthcare  When we come up against Donald Trump  the team that has been trying to take away healthcare from millions of people  what's going to matter most is we are the people on the side of those who need healthcare across this country  That's who Democrats are  27 Look  I think no one is above the law  and that includes the President of the United States  We watched on Wednesday as Republicans  all but one locked arms to protect him from impeachment  but we need to reestablish the rule of law in this country  I believe in an independent commission  in our justice department that investigates crimes committed by our own government  It is an important part of accountability  It is an important part for every administration  that we hold ourselves accountable to the American people  Look  people around this country are losing faith in our government  They're losing faith that government works for them  They see a government that just works great if you're rich  It works great if you're a lobbyist  It works great if you're a corporate executive  but they see themselves and their children with less and less and less  and we could do something about it  64 It's not enough simply to talk about the future  We have to be willing to stand up to those who now control our government  and make that government instead work for us  We can do child care in this country for every baby  We can invest in our public schools  We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans  but only if we are willing to take control of our government away from the giant corporations and billionaires  return it to the people  This is about our government  This is about our democracy  This is about our future  39 No  Look  I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee  so I get the briefings from the generals on a regular basis  I've been to Afghanistan  to Iraq  I've been to Jordan  I've been throughout the region  I've been there with John McCain  I've been there with Lindsey Graham to ask the hard questions about what's happening  to ask our generals  to ask their generals to ask people who are on the ground  And the bottom line is  nobody sees a solution to this war  Nobody can describe what winning looks like  All they can describe is endless war  33 And I realized there are people on this debate stage who are willing to say  yeah  we'll leave our troops there for five more years  for 10 more years  Lindsey Graham has said he's willing to leave troops for 100 more years  And yet  what has all these years of war brought us  Right now  the Afghan Government controls less than 60  of the land  People don't have faith in it  It's a corrupt government  The opium trade is higher than ever  28 Look  we sent our troops in and they did their best  They were there for us  but we need to be there for them  And that means  not send our troops to do work that cannot be solved militarily  It is time to bring our combat troops home  It is time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan  21 Yes  0 So I want to hear the plan  not just a  we need it now  we need it for the next day  we need it for the six months  And I want to know where our allies are  We all have an interest in dealing with terrorism and controlling terrorism  but that means it can't just be the United States waging endless war  That does not make us safer  It does not make the region safer  It does not make the world safer  We should work with our allies in managing terrorism  but we need to end this war in Afghanistan  We cannot wait five more years  or 10 more years  or until we turn the corner 10 more times  We need to bring our combat troops home  41 Look  we have a gun violence problem in America  It is about the mass shootings that we hear about in our schools and that frighten us  about it in theaters and in churches  It's also though about shootings that occur on sidewalks and in playgrounds  often in communities of color that are hit hardest  but there are no headlines over those  It's also about suicide and the increasing lethality of suicide because of the availability of guns  It is also about the increased chances that it's usually a woman will die of domestic violence if she is with a violent man and a gun is in the home  42 We need to think of this problem not as one and done or three things and done  We need to think of it just like we did on auto safety  We just keep coming back  We treat it like the public health emergency that it is  But the question we should be asking ourselves is when America  across this country  including gun owners  agree in certain basic things  universal background checks  get assault weapons off the streets  Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate  33 And the answer is 90   think about this  more than 90  of Americans agree on this  We can't get a vote in the United States Senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots  Until we attack the corruption in Washington  the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying  we're not going to be able to meet our promises  And one more  until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster  the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make  We have to be willing to build a future that works  not for a gun industry  but that works for the rest of America and protects our children  44 Look  I've lived in an America in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and that's what we have to remember about this  States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well  If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies  then it's going to mean we can't simply rely on the courts  Three out of every four people in America believe right now that the rule of Roe versus Wade should be the law  That means we should be pushing for a Congressional solution as well  It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a woman's choice  51 No  You have to own up to the fact  and it's important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system  For the exact same crimes  study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained  to be arrested  to be taken to trial  to be wrongfully convicted  and receive harsher sentences  We need to rework our criminal justice system  from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system  and how we help people come back into the community  42 But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically  We need to start having race conscious laws  Housing  for example  I have a great housing plan to build more housing in America  but understand it was the policy of the United States of America to discriminate against African Americans and any other people of color for buying homes until 1965  You can't just repeal that and say  Okay  now everything is even   It's not  We need race conscious laws in education and employment  in entrepreneurship  to make this country a country of opportunity for everyone  no matter the color of their skin  47 I'm glad to stand on this stage with my fellow Democrats who talk about how important the black community is  at least at election time  Year after year after year  election after election after election  Democrats go to people in the black community and say  Boy  we really care about these issues  Racism is terrible  we all want to do something   and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse  Well I think it's time we have real  concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people's lives  I proposed a two cent wealth tax  And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax  We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans  and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college  borrow more money while they're in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out  that one law is going to help close the black white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points  59 We aren't making a difference in America  We're saying to the rich folks  You keep your money  and the rest of us will talk about racism but not really do anything   I think the time for that is over  I'm ready to get in this fight and really make a change  14 Look  I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States  I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it  and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns out to do it  I heard everyone here talking about as Democrats  we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end this unlimited spending  yeah  Except everyone on this stage except Amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending  So if you really want to live where you say  then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs  51 Look  I think the way we build a democracy going forward is not billionaires reaching in their own pockets or people sucking up to billionaires  The way we build it going forward is we have a grassroots movement funded from the grassroots up  That's the way I'm running this campaign  If you think it's the right way to run a campaign  to go elizabethwarren com and pitch in  5  because understand this  our democracy hangs in the balance  If we have to fund through billionaires  then we're just going to be an America that's going to work better and better for billionaires and not for anyone else  39 Yes I did  and I'll tell you why  because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of Donald Trump's trade policies  There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they can't get enforcement of any workers' rights  So this NAFTA provision  after a lot of negotiation with Democrats  Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better  This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country  I'm saying  I'll sign up for that and then I'll get up tomorrow morning and I'll start working hard for a better trade deal on climate  a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it  Everyone wants to get to the American market  We should be raising standards on climate around the world to get access to our market  53 So I started my grownup life as a special education teacher  I learned early on about the worth of every single human being  and I believe that the best investment we can make as a nation  the best investment we can make as human beings  is to invest in our children  We've had enough of making rhetoric around this  Everyone says they love the kids  but here's the deal  It's time to come up with real plans to make that happen  I've talked before about a two cent wealth tax  but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care  universal pre K for every three year old and four year old in America  and we can stop exploiting the people  largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America  61 We want to have a real future in this country  then invest in our children  Don't leave public education just to our localities in our states  Be a good federal partner  Put real money into our schools  put real money into housing  put real money into into healthcare  Put real money into the future of our children  That's how we build the America of our best values  29 I believe the principal job of the Commander in Chief is to keep America safe and I think that's about judgment  I think it starts with knowing our military  I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee  I work with our generals  with our military leaders  with our intelligence  but I also visit our troops  I visit our troops around the world  I've been to Afghanistan  to Iraq  to Jordan  to South Korea  I've been to lots of places to talk with our troops  And I fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay  that they get the housing and medical benefits that they've been promised  that they don't get cheated by giant financial institutions  37 I have three brothers who are in the military and I know how much our military families sacrifice  but I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways  We have to think about cyber  We have to think about climate  We also have to think about how we spend money  We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington  between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon  That is corruption  pure and simple  We need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget  We need to depend on all of our tools  diplomatic  economic  working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots  41 No  I think we need to get our combat troops out  You know  we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops  Our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take  but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily  Our keeping combat troops there is not helping  We need to work with our allies  We need to use our economic tools  We need to use our diplomatic tools  32 Now look  I understand there are people on this stage when it comes to Afghanistan  for example  who talk about five more years  10 more years  Shoot Lindsay Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years  No one has a solution and an end point  We need to get our combat troops out  They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region  22 Well imminent threat  but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat  That is what the constitution provides and that's what as Commander in Chief  I will do  But I just want to be clear  everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war  but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it  On Senate Armed Services Committee  we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says   You know  we've just turned the corner and now it's all going to be different   33 And then what happens  It's all the same for another year  Someone new comes in and we've just turned the corner  We've turned the corners so many times we're going in circles in these regions  This has got to stop  It's not enough to say   Someday we're going to get out   No one on the ground  None of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out  It's time to get our combat troops home  23 I do  I wasn't here  I haven't been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA  but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe because I didn't think it was in the interest of the American people  the American workers or environmental interests  But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars  We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut  really don't have enforcement on workers rights  31 This new trade deal is a modest improvement  Senator Sanders himself has said so  It will give some relief to our farmers  it will give some relief to our workers  I believe we accept that relief  we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal  We need a coherent trade policy  We need a policy that actually helps our workers  our farmers  We need them at the table  not just a trade policy written for big international companies  I'm ready to have that fight but let's help the people who need help right now  36 Our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility  It's been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated  The United States has had a strategy for decades  and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators  a small number  and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations  not good for America  not good for American workers  not good for the environment  33 We need a different approach to trade  and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals  Everybody wants to get to the American market  and we need to put some standards in place  You want to be able to sell your goods here  then you've got to meet some environmental standards  You've got to meet labor standards  19 We need a coherent approach  1 I disagreed  Bernie is my friend  and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie  But look  This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised  and it's time for us to attack it head on  I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record  22 So can a woman beat Donald Trump  Look at the men on this stage  Collectively  they have lost ten elections  The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women  The only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me  and here's what I know  The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency  48 We need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party  bring everyone in  and give everyone a Democrat to believe in  That's my plan  and that is why I'm going to win  13 When  1 30 years ago  0 Wasn't that 30 years ago  3 I said I was the only one who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years  4 So I do think it's the right question  how do we beat Trump  Here's the thing  Since Donald Trump was elected  women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races  In 2018  we took back the House  We took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters  23 Look  Don't deny that the question is there  Back in the 1960s  people asked   Could a Catholic win   Back in 2008  people asked if an African American could win  Both times  the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes  got behind their candidate  and we changed America  That's who we are  22 So we need to start with what's happening in America  People are suffering  I'll just pick one  36 million people last year went to the doctor  got a prescription  This is what they needed to get well  and they couldn't afford to have the prescription filled  They looked at it and said   It's either groceries or this prescription   16 My approach to this is we've got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible  I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime  13 What I can do are the things that I can do as President on the first day  We can cut the cost of prescription drugs  I'll use the power that's already given to the President to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV AIDS drugs  Let's get some relief to those families  and I will defend the Affordable Care Act  21 I've got a plan to expand healthcare  But let's keep in mind  when we come to a general election  we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare  but we're going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that  I'll take our side of the argument any day  We're going to beat him on this  20 So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just can't even afford to have a prescription filled  We all talk about plans  healthcare plans that we have  and these plans are paid for  The problem is that plans like the mayor's and like the vice president's is that they are an improvement  They are an improvement over where we are right now  Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can't afford to get them filled  What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from  We can ask those at the very top  the top 1  to pay a little more  Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes  We can have them pay  and we can go after the corporate tax cheats  And when we do that  we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people  50 Tax cheats  And when we do that  we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people  Yes  we build on the Affordable Care Act  but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people  and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them  19 Look  the numbers that the mayor's offering just don't add up  The average family in America last year paid  12 000 in some combination of deductibles and copays  and uncovered expenses and fees  You can't cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about  The way we have to approach this is we've got to build this and we've got to build the alliances to make this happen  I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs  We can get help to families  but we have to be willing to work together  36 We can let people experience what healthcare is like when it's you and your doctor  your mental health professional  your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle   crosstalk 01 09 12  When people try it and use it  then  12 So  let's do this both ways  What I also have said is I'm just going to use the power that is available  and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day  and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs  I will lower the price of insulin  We already have the legal authority with the president to do that  President just hasn't picked up and used it  I will lower the price of EpiPens  of HIV AIDS drugs  That's going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately  but you know there are a whole lot of drugs  about 90  of drugs that are not under patent  They're generic drugs  but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up  So my view is let's give them a little competition  46 The government lets contracts for all kinds of things  They let contracts to build buildings  they let contracts to build military weapons  Let's let the contracts out  put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices  This is a way to make markets work  not to try to move away from the market  You don't have to even use price controls  The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be  34 No  actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone  It just has some people adding a small payment  but understand this about the plan  I've been there  You know  I remember when I was a young mom  I had two little kids and I had my first real university teaching job  It was hard work  I was excited  but it was childcare that nearly brought me down  We went through one childcare after another and it just didn't work  27 If I hadn't been saved by my Aunt Bee  I was ready to quit my job  And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on  How many of my daughter's generation get knocked off the track and don't get back on  How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on  19 I have a two cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre K for every three year old and four year old in America  and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work  largely black and brown women  We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America  That's an investment in our babies  That's an investment in their mamas and their daddies and it's an investment in our teachers and in our economy  33 It's what we need to do  0 So look  the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America  We need to ask people with fortunes above  50 million to pay more  and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about  19 million in the first year in taxes  If he wants to send his kid to public university  then I'm okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here  We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because that's how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it  bring down the national debt  You do universal child care  and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work  A lot of mamas who can finish their education  We make that investment in universal college  We've got  crosstalk 01 24 44  people who would finish an education  50 Look  some things are more important than politics  I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America  It says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the United States  If we have an impeachment trial  I will be there because it is my responsibility  But understand this  what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people  and something we should all be talking about  is the corruption of this administration  That's what lies at the heart of it  It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first  not the American people  not the interests of the United States of America  not even in helping Ukraine defend against Russia  It is about him helping himself  That is what we need to do to win this election  We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats  we're not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations  people who want to help themselves  that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people  That's why we're here  64 Yes  Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated  I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day  I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place  I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling  That'll help us get in the right directions  I'll bring in the farmers  Farmers can be part of the climate solution  We should see this though for the problem it is  Mr  Steyer talks about it being problem number one  Understand this  we have known about this climate crisis for decades  Back in the 1990s  we were calling it global warming  but we knew what it was  Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem  52 But you know what happened  The industry came in and said  we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change  Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption  That is the only way we will make progress on climate  on gun safety  on healthcare  on all of the issues  20 That matter to us  1 So I was born and raised in Oklahoma  I have three older brothers who are all retired  who are all back there still  And two of my three brothers are Republicans  And sure  there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic  Republican talking points  But the truth is there's a whole lot we agree on  You know  my brothers just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon  that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes   make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes  My brother said   I don't get this  I have to pay my taxes  Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense   42 They understand that we have an America right now that's working great for those at the top  It's just not working for anyone else  We have a chance to unite  unite as Democrats  but also with independents and Republicans  who are sick of living in a country that's working great for the politicians that are taking the money  It's working great for the lobbyists  It's working great for the corporate executives  It's just not working for everyone else  I'm building the grassroots movement  leading the fight  We're going to make this America work for everyone else  That is how we're going to beat Donald Trump  38 So  much is broken in this country  I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didn't get to talk about tonight  How the disability community is struggling for true equality  how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country  How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink  How trans women  particularly trans women of color are at risk  Black infant mortality  climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities  People who are being crushed by student loan debt  farmers who are barely holding on  people struggling with mental illness  And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and it's filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history  our moment when no one is left on the sidelines  Our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country  Our moment when we build the movement to make real change  hope and courage  That is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the United States of America  76 So I see this as a constitutional moment  Last night  the president was impeached  and everyone now in the Senate who's taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution  and that doesn't mean loyalty to an individual  it doesn't mean loyalty to a political party  it means loyalty to our country  and that vote will play out over the next several weeks  But the way I see this is we've now seen the impact of corruption  and that's what's clearly on the stage in 2020  is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history  This president has made corruption  originally  his argument  that he would drain the swamp  And yet he came to Washington  broke that promise  and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well connected  from tax breaks to ambassadorships  We have to prosecute the case against him  and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight  not for the wealthy and well connected  but to fight for everyone else  That's why I'm in this race  81 I do  0 Well  I want to ask  2 This question  1 Because here's the problem  I'm proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rising GDP  rising corporate profits  is not being felt by millions of families across this country  I'm proud to stand on a stage with people who see that America's middle class is being hollowed out  and that working families and poor people are being left behind  23 What we need to talk about  though  is why that has happened  and the answer is we've got a government that works great for those with money  and doesn't work for much of anyone else  We have a government that works great for giant drug companies  just not for someone trying to fill a prescription  Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border  just not for the people whose lives are torn apart  Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere  but not for the rest of us  who see climate change bearing down upon us  And when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well connected and for no one else  that is corruption  pure and simple  and we need to call it out for what it is  55 Oh  they're just wrong  Let's start with a wealth tax  The idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country  50 million dollars and above  For two cents  what can we do  We can invest in the rest of America  We can provide universal childcare  early childhood education for every baby in this country  age zero to five  Universal pre K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage  37   Pre K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher  We can do even more for our public schools  for college graduates  we can cancel student loan debt  but think about the economic impact of that  You leave two cents with the billionaires  They're not eating more pizzas  they're not buying more cars  We invest that 2  in early childhood education and childcare  That means those babies get top notch care  It means their mamas can finish their education  It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs  harder jobs  longer hours  We can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up  That's how we built it in small towns  that's how we built it in rural America and that's how we built it in urban America  An economy that works  55 Not from Wall Street  but that works for main stram  0 So I see right now is  we've got to get the carbon  we've got to stop putting more carbon into the air  We've got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water and that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place  I will not build more nuclear  I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science  what we put into research and development  We need to do what we do best  And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader  But understand the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keeps saying the right thing  but continue to take money from the oil industry  Continue to bow down to the lobbyist  to the lawyers  to the think tanks to the bought and paid for experts  55 America understands that we've got to make change and we're running out of time  That climate change threatens every living thing on this planet  But getting Congress to act  they just don't want to hear it  And if we don't attack the corruption first  if we don't attack the corruption head on  then we're not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate  on gun safety  on drug pricing  on all of the big problems that face us  We need a Washington that doesn't just work for the rich and the powerful  We need one that works for our families  37 Yes  it's time to close this detention facility  It not only costs us money  it is an international embarrassment  We have to be an America that lives our values every single day  We can't be an America that stands up and asks people to fight alongside us  as we did with the Kurds in fighting ISIS  and then turn around in the blink of a tweet and say that we're turning our backs on the people who stood beside us  After that  who wants to be an ally of the United States  We have to be an America that understands the difference and recognizes the difference between our allies  the people who will work alongside us  and the dictators who would do us harm  And we need to treat our allies better than we treat the dictators  That needs to be our job as an America  58 We have the finest military on earth  All three of my brothers served and we have people on this stage who have served and I'm deeply grateful for that  Our military is strong and important  but we need to be an America that relies on our State Department  that relies on diplomacy  that relies on our economic power and that relies on working together with the rest of the world to build a world that is sustainable environmentally and economically for everyone  31 It's on a collision course with China but not for war  What we have to make clear is that we in fact are not going to abide by what they've done  1 million Uyghurs  as you pointed out  Muslims  are in concentration camps  That's where they are right now  They're being abused  They're in concentration camps  And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped  we should be moving 60  of our seat power to that area of the world  To let in fact the Chinese understand that they're not going to go any further  We are going to be there to protect other folks  33 Secondly  we in fact should make sure that we began to rebuild our alliances  which Trump has demolished  with Japan and South Korea  Australia and Indonesia  We in fact need to have allies who understand that we're going to stop the Chinese from their actions  We should be gone to the UN immediately and sought sanctions against them and the United Nations for what they did  We have to be firm  We don't have to go to war but we have to make it clear   This is as far as you go  China   And in terms of their military buildup  it's real but it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are  We're not looking for a war but we've got to make clear we are Pacific power and we are not going to back away 41 I'd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated  I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America  whose voices get heard  I believe he's talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out  And for me  the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020  I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual  And now I'm crowding in on 100 000 selfies  That's 100 000 hugs and handshakes and stories  Stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt  stories from people who can't pay their medical bills  stories from people who can't find childcare  Now  most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5 000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken  in order to have a conversation  and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador  77 No  I want to finish this  Those selfies cost nobody anything  And I get it  In a democracy  we all have a lot of different points of view and everybody gets one vote  But here's the thing  people who can put down  5 000 to have a picture taken  don't have the same priorities as people who are struggling with student loan debt or struggling to pay off medical debt  I'm running a campaign where people whose voices get heard  We can't have people who can put down  5 000 for a check  drown out the voices of everyone else  They don't in my campaign and they won't in my white house  46 So  the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served  900 a bottle wine  Think about who comes to that  He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door  but this one was closed door  We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States  Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States  39 I do not sell access to my time  I don't do call time with millionaires and billionaires  7 I don't meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors and look  I've taken one that ought to be an easy step for everyone here  I've said to anyone who wants to donate to me  if you want to donate to me  that's fine  but don't come around later expecting to be named ambassador because that's what goes on in these high dollar fundraisers  I said no and I asked everybody on this stage to join me  This ought to be an easy step and here's the problem  If you can't stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy  can't stand up to the wealthy and well connected when it's relatively easy when you're a candidate  then how can the American people believe you're going to stand up to the wealthy and well connected when you're president and it's really hard  48 He addressed me directly  2 So as I've talked about before  I have a 2 cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies age zero to five  To put an historic  800 billion investment in public schools  K through 12 and that will permit us to offer technical school 2 year college  4 year college for every single person who wants an education  Cancel student loan debt four 50   Put a  50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans  42 Look  this is about money  but this is also about values  We need to make an investment in our future and the best way to do that is let's invest in the public education of our children  That starts when they're babies and it goes long after high school  We want to have families  I meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt  That's why I have a proposal  popular among Democrats  popular among Republicans  popular among independents to ask those at the top to pay a little more  So somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves  Start a small business  buy a car  create a future for themselves and for this country  48 So wait  he mentioned me by name  3 Look  the mayor wants billionaires to pay one tuition for their own kids  I want a billionaire to pay enough to cover tuition for all of our kids because that's how we build a future  The other part is we've got to deal with student loan debt  and right now most of the people on the stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionately affects people of color  African Americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school  more likely to borrow more money while they're in school and have a harder time paying it off  We want to make an investment in the future then open up education for all of our kids  That's how we build our future  48 No  Come on  5 So I was a special education teacher and I loved that work because it gave me a chance to work straight up with people to recognize the worth of every human being  I had four to 46 year olds who were in special ed and what do we need to do  That's why I have a plan as a special ed teacher to fully fund IDEA  so every child with disabilities will get the full education they need  27 My housing plan is about investing in more housing across this country and rural America and urban America in small town America  but it's also about making sure that people who want to live independently  people who have disabilities will have housing available to them  I make a part of my job to spill that we are going to make sure as president  I will make sure that the people who want to bid on federal contracts are treating people with disabilities fairly and paying them fairly  You've got to go at it at every part of what we do because as a nation  this is truly a measure of who we are  We believe in treating these the least of thy brethren as people of value  and that is how we make a better America  51 The transgender community has been marginalized in every way possible  And one thing that the president of the United States can do is lift up attention  lift up their voices  lift up their lives  Here's a promise I made  I will go to the Rose Garden once every year to read the names of transgender women of people of color who have been killed in the past year  I will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness  I will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification  I will do everything I can to make sure that we are in America that leaves no one behind  53 So this is about costs  It's about costs on middle class families  Last year  36 million Americans didn't have a prescription filled because they couldn't afford it  And those are people with health insurance as well  People who can't do the copays  people who can't do the deductibles  People who find out that the drug is not covered  So here's how I approach this  I want to do the most good I can for the most people as quickly as possible  On day one  I'm going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs like Epipens and insulin and bring down those prices  33 The president can do that  I love saying this all by herself and I will do it  That's going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars and then in the first hundred days  because I found a way to pay for full healthcare coverage for everyone  without raising taxes on middle class families  I'm going to make available to people for a full healthcare coverage for 135 million people  It'll be at no cost at all and they can opt into that system  For others  It will be at a low cost  We have got to start moving and move fast  crosstalk 00 01 03 36  and do that  We can do that on 50 votes  44 We can do a labor action and just all go on strike on this one Andrew  23 I will ask for forgiveness  I know that sometimes I get really worked up and sometimes I get a little hot  I don't really mean to  What happens is when you do 100 000 selfies with people you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments  I met someone just last week in Nevada  who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because he's a veteran  But his sister has diabetes  his daughter has diabetes  and they simply can't afford insulin  So the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people  When I think about what we could do if we get a majority in the house  a majority in the Senate  and get back the white house  we could make this country work for people like that man  And that's why I'm in this fight  71 I think everyone up here on this stage  and those are not on the stage who've run  we owe them because they're all pushing for the same exact thing  You're not the only one that does Senator  I've done thousands of them  And the crew that follows me can tell you there's not one line I go through  I don't have at least to have a dozen people come up and hug me and say  can you help me  I just lost my daughter 10 days ago  Can you help me  Tell me am I going to be okay  Can you help me  I just lost  inaudible  and they'd go and lay out their problems  My wife and I have a call list of somewhere between 20 and a hundred people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them I'm here  39 I give them my private phone number  They keep in touch with me  A little kid who says   stuttering  I can't talk  What do I do  I have scores of these young women and men who I keep in contact with  And the reason I would give everyone here at gift is because they want to do something like I do  of making their lives better because there's a lot of people who are hurting very  very  very badly  28 Did you call my name  This is a dark moment in America and yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope  All three of my brothers served in the military  They're all retired  They're all back in Oklahoma  One is a Democrat  two are Republicans  But you know what unites my three brothers Amazon  they are furious that Amazon reported  10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes  My brothers are part of why is ready to root out corruption and fight back  and that gives us a base to work from  America is ready for 2 cent wealth tax  It's supported by Republicans  Democrats and Independents  and it lets us invest in all of our children  52 America is ready to expand social security payments and disability payments by  200 a month and we can do it  You know  someone asks what this would mean  you just give somebody  200 a month  They asked me this in a town hall  and a lady who wanted it said   you know what it will mean to me  It'll mean I can get a prescription filled  and I can still buy toilet paper this same week   That's where Americans are right now  I am not working for millionaires and billionaires  I'm here to work for the tens of millions of people across this country who are ready to build an America that won't just work those at the top  but that will work for everyone  44 Of course I will  And the obvious answer is to say  first read the Mueller Report  all 442 pages of it  that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice  and when Congress failed to act at that moment  and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again  And that's what's happened with Ukraine  We have to establish the principle  no one is above the law  We have a constitutional responsibility  and we need to meet it  But I want to add one more part based on today's testimony  and that is  how did Ambassador Sondland get there  This is not a man who had any qualifications except one  He wrote a check a million dollars  and that tells us about what's happening in Washington  43 The corruption  how money buys its way into Washington  You know  I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they're going to get ambassadorships on the other side  And I've taken a pledge  Anyone who wants to give me a big donation  don't ask to be an ambassador  because I'm not going to have that happen  I asked everyone who's running for president to join me in that  and not a single person has so far  I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say  we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder  37 So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us  And that is  that we want to build an America that works for the people  not one that just works for rich folks  You know  I have proposed a two cent wealth tax  That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets  Your first 50 billion is free and clear  But your 50 billionth and first dollar  got to pitch in 2 cents  And when you hit a billion dollars  you've got to pitch in a few pennies more  Here's the thing  doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone  It's about saying you built something great in this country  good for you  But you did it using workers  All of us help pay to educate  You did it using  you're getting your goods to on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for  You did it protected by police and firefighters  all of us help pay the salaries for  53 So when you make it big  when you make it really big  when you make it top one 10th of 1  big  pitch in 2 cents  so everybody else gets a chance to make it  And here's the thing  that's something that Democrats care about  independents care about  and Republicans care about  Because regardless of party affiliation  people understand across this country  our government is working better and better for the billionaires  for the rich  for the well connected  and worse and worse for everyone else  We come together when we acknowledge that and  crosstalk 00 11 50  real change  33 Sure  So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax  Two cents on the top one 10th of 1  in this country  and we can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five  That is transformative  We can provide universal pre K for every three year old and four year old in America  We can stop exploiting the women  largely black and brown women who do this work  and we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America  We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools  We can make college tuition free for every kid  We can put  50 billion into historically black colleges and universities  and we can cancel student loan debt for 95  of the folks who've got it  Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation's future  53 Sure  1 So  just the idea behind what is fair  today the 99  in America are on track to pay about 7 2  of their total wealth in taxes  12 The top one 10th of 1  that I want to say pay two cents more  they'll pay 3 2  in America  I'm tired of freeloading billionaires  I think it's time that we ask those at the very top to pay more  so that every single one of our children gets  16 I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills  37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can't afford it  People didn't take the test the doctor recommended because they just can't afford it  So here is my plan  Let's bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can  as fast as we can  On day one  as president  I will do  bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens  That's going to save tens of millions  hundreds of millions of dollars for people  36 I'm going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump Administration  And in the first hundred days  I'm going to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them  Everybody under the age of 18  everybody who has a family of four  income less than  50 000  I'm going to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and longterm care  And then in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it  and taste it and live with it  we're going to vote  and we're going to want Medicare for all  41 Yes  Think of it this way  Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time  affordable housing  Also private developers  they've gone up to the mansions  They're not building the little two bedroom  one bath house that I grew up in  garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers  So I've got a plan  23 For 3 2 million new housing units in America  those are housing units for working families for the working poor  for the poor poor for seniors who want to age in place for people with disabilities  For people who are coming back from being incarcerated  It's about tenants rights  but there's one more piece  17 Housing is how we build wealth in America  The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people   You're cut out of the deal   That was known as red lining when I built a housing plan  It's not only a housing plan about building new units  it's a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government sponsored discrimination  how we need to address it and we need to say we're going to reverse it  29 It's a sorry  you're not sorry  2 Yes  I think it should be  All three of my brothers served in the military  One was career military  the other two also served  I think it's an important part of who we are as Americans and I think the notion of shared service is important  It's how we help bring our nation together  it's how people learn to work together from different regions  people who grew up differently  It's also about how families share that sacrifice  I remember what it was like when I was a little girl  my brother  my oldest brother who served five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam  And what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox  had we heard from Don Reed  how's he doing  46 And if there was a letter  she was brighter than the day  And if it wasn't  she'd say   Well  maybe tomorrow   This is about building for our entire nation and I believe we should do that  I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country  For example  what I want to do is for our federal lands  I want to bring in 10 000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change  37 We can do this as a nation  2 Can I respond on this  1 I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we're willing to get in the fight for  And I just want to give one example around this  Senator Harris  rightly raised the question of economic justice  Let me give a specific example  and that is student loan debt  Right now African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college  borrow more money while they're in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out  Today in America  a new study came out 20 years out  Whites borrowed money  94  of them have paid off their student loan debt  5  of African Americans had paid it off  I believe that means everyone on the stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness  It will help close the black white wealth gap  Let's do something tangible and real to make change in this country  53 If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense  of course  we should do it  The real point here is that we need to stop this man made crisis at the border  Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America  He has withdrawn aid  that means that families have to flee for their lives  have to flee for any economic opportunity  You know what  I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families  36 I went down to the border  I went down there and immediately  I was in McAllen  Texas  and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like  There was like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women  cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys  I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers and she told me she'd given a drink to a police officer  and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police  She knew what that meant  She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border  We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect  A great nation does not separate children from their families  We need to live our values at the border every single day  47 So would we all  2 Look  I believe that abortion rights are human rights  I believe that they are also economic rights  Protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party  Understand this  When someone makes abortion illegal in America  rich women will still get abortions  It's just going to fall hard on poor women  It's going to fall hard on girls  Women who don't even know that they're pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle  I want to be an America where everybody has a chance  I know it can be a hard decision for people  but here's the thing  when it comes down to that decision  a woman should be able to call on her mother  She should be able to call on her partner  She should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi  but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government  56 I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for  I'm not here to try to drive anyone out of this party  I'm not here to try to build fences  but I am here to say   This is what I will fight for as President of the United States   The women of America can count on me  16 Thank you  I listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas  but I take a look at the issues we've talked about  We've talked about climate change  we've talked about defense spending  we've talked about private health insurance  We should have talked about gun violence  What do these issues have in common  Well first  they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives  What is the second thing they have in common  We know what we need to do  We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of Americans are with us on it and yet we don't make change  Why not  Because of corruption  because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription  It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms  instead of into our public schools  53 We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else  I have the biggest anti corruption plan since Watergate  It involves ending lobbying as we know it  blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington  making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online  We have to have the courage not to make just individual changes  not to fight for little pieces  We want to make real progress on climate  then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country  42 I am so grateful to be here and I am grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher  a chance to become a college professor  a chance to become a United States Senator   14  NAME  4 Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics  And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry  When I made the decision to run for president  I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment  but when the Mueller report came out  I read it  all 442 pages  And when I got to the end  I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well  that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly  And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry  Now that didn't happen and look what happened as a result  Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer  broke it again this fall  You know  we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States  Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences  This is about Donald Trump  but understand it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country  The impeachment must go forward  77 So I have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking  middle class families  costs will go down  You know  the way I see this is I have been out all around this country  I've done 140 town halls now  Been to 27 States and Puerto Rico  shoot  I have done 70 000 selfies  which must be the new measure of democracy  And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly  So I've talked with the family  the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer  I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes  I've talked to the young man who has M S  And here's the thing about all of them  they all had great health insurance right at the beginning  But then they found out when they really needed it  when the costs went up  that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing  60 Look  the way I see this  it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer  To think about the changes in your family  if your mom's got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with M S  But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your healthcare after that  19 So the way I see this  it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face  So let me be clear on this  Costs will go up for the wealthy  they will go up for big corporations and for middle class families  they will go down  I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families  24 So let's be clear  whenever someone hears the term Medicare for All who want it  understand what that really means  It's Medicare for All who can afford it  and that's the problem we've got  Medicare for All is the gold standard  It is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American  including the family whose child's been diagnosed with cancer  including the person who's just gotten an M S  diagnosis  That's how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare  We can pay for this  I've laid out the basic principles  Costs are going to go up for the wealthy  they're going to go up for big corporations  They will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs because costs are what people care about  I've been studying this for the biggest part of my life  why people go bankrupt  53 Sure  0 I'd like to be able to respond  0 My view on this and what I have committed to  is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families  I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for All who can afford it  that will leave behind millions of people who cannot  And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says   Sorry  we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments  We're not covering your expensive treatments for M S  We're not covering what covering what you need   30 Yeah  I didn't spend most of my time in Washington  I spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke  And one of the principle reasons for that is the cost of healthcare  And back when I was studying it  two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance  The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of healthcare  And look  you can try to spin this any way you want  I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back  I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works  And a part of that is we've got stop Americans from going bankrupt over healthcare costs  53 The data show that we've had a lot of problems with losing jobs  but the principle reason has been bad trade policy  The principle reason has been a bunch of corporations  giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade  giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America  They have no loyalty to American workers  They have no loyalty to American consumers  They have no loyalty to American communities  They are loyal only to their own bottom line  33 I have a plan to fix that  and it's accountable capitalism  It says   You want to have one of the giant corporations in America  Then  by golly  40  of your board of directors should be elected by your employees   That'll make a difference  When a corporation decides   Gee  we can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico   when there are people on the board in the board room saying   No  Do you know what that does to our company  Do you know what that does to our community  what it does to our workers   We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate  We need to restructure strength in this economy and that's where it starts  44 I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class  Actually  I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security  It's one of the reasons that I put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add  200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now  That  200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more  It also has a provision for your wife  for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors  and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security  50 So after a lifetime of hard work  people are entitled to retire with dignity  5 I see this is an important question  but I want to understand the data on this  4 I want to make sure we're responding to make this work  2 I think this is about our values as a country  Show me your budget  show me your tax plans  and we'll know what your values are  Right now in America  the top one tenth of 1  have so much wealth  understand this  that if we put a two cent tax on their 50 000 001st dollar and on every dollar after that  we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five  universal pre K for every child  raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America  provide for universal tuition free college  put  50 billion into historically black colleges and universities  50  and cancel  No  let me finish please  and cancel student loan debt for 95  of the people who have it  My question is not   Why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax   It's   Why does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans   23 Understand  taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way tax and wealth does  that the rich are not like you and me  The really  really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth and it just keeps growing  We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation  Look  I understand that this is hard  but I think as Democrats  we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard  not when we dream small and quit before we get started  35 I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive  Look  I don't have a beef with billionaires  My problem is  you made a fortune in America  you had a great idea  you got out there and worked for it  good for you  But you built that fortune in America  I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate  You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for  You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for  All I'm saying is  you make it to the top  the top one tenth of 1   then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it  45 But that is  1 That is the point  This is universal childcare for every baby in this country  Early educational opportunities for every child  Universal pre K  no matter where you live  for every three year old and four year old  Raising the wages  16 No  Raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country  This is about universal college  about investment in our HBCUs  about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden  18  that is crushing 43 million American  1 So look  I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East  I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East  But we have to do it the right way  the smart way  What this President has done is that he has sucked up to dictators  he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand  he has cut and run on our allies  and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America  In Syria  he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis  he has helped ISIS get another foothold  a new lease on life  I sit on the Armed Services Committee  I talk with our military leaders about this  44 I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed  We need to get out  6   but we need to do this through a negotiated solution  3 There is no military solution  2   in this region  2 Look  I want to get what work's done  I want to use the method we used  for example  with machine guns  We registered them  We put in a huge penalty if you didn't register them and a huge tax on them and let people turn them in  and it got machine guns out of the hands of people  But the problem here that we need to focus on is first how widespread gun violence is  As you've rightly identified  it's not just about mass shootings  it's what happens in neighborhoods all across this country  33 It is about suicide  It is about domestic violence  This is not going to be a one and done that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we're done  We have to reduce gun violence overall  and the question we have to ask is why hasn't it happened  You say  we're so close  We have been so close  I stood in the United States Senate in 2013 when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation  31   and it didn't pass because of the filibuster  2 We've got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibusters  4   or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens  4 Well  I say I will out work  out organize and outlast anyone  and that includes Donald Trump  Mike Pence  or whoever the Republicans get stuck with  Look  the way I see this  the way we're going to win is by addressing head on what millions of Americans know in their bones  and that is that the wealthy and the well connected have captured our democracy  and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind  Political pundits and Washington insiders and  shoot  people in our own party don't want to admit that  41 They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy  They are wrong  If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump  it will be business as usual  then we will lose  Democrats win when we call out what's broken and we show how to fix it  Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives  things like childcare and healthcare and housing costs  Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight  40 Look  I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy  It's time to fight back  Think about it this way  When you talk about how it works in competition  about 8   9  of all retail sales happen in bricks and sticks stores  happen at Walmart  About 49  of all sales online happen in one place  That's Amazon  It collects information from every little business  and then Amazon does something else  It runs the platform  gets all the information  and then goes into competition with those little businesses  Look  you get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team  but you don't get to do both at the same time  We need to enforce our antitrust laws  break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech  big pharma  big oil  all of them  60 Look I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter  I want to push him out of The White House  That's our job  But the way  7 But the way   But let's figure  0 No  Let's figure out  1   why it is that we have had laws on the book  3   for antitrust for over a century  Yet for decades now we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington  Big Ag  how the gun industry  big tech  We really need to address the elephant in the room and that is how campaigns are financed  19 I announced this morning  0 I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives  from Wall Street executives  We've already agreed Bernie and I  we're not taking any money from big pharma executives  You can't go behind closed doors  and take the money of these executives  and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws  We need campaign finance rules and practices  29  crosstalk 02 14 24    that support us all  4 Yes  0 Look I think all of the rules should apply across the board  I don't have a problem with that  3 What I do have a problem with  2   is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives  I we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives  If we are going to talk about Wall Street  and having some serious regulation over Wall Street  we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives  33 So long as that's  1 I think there are a number of options  I think as Mayor Buttigieg said there are many different ways  People are talking about different options  I think we may have to talk about them  But on Roe versus Wade can we just pause for a minute here  I lived in an America where abortion was illegal  Rich women still got abortions because they could travel  they could go to places where it was legal  What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor  are the young  are 14 year olds who were molested by a family member  We now have support across this country  Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe versus Wade  When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it we should be able to get that passed through Congress  52 We should not leave this to the Supreme Court we should do it through democracy because we can  5 You started this question with how you got something done  Following the financial crash of 2008 I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people  All of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said   Don't even try because you will never get it passed   Sure enough the big banks fought us  the Republicans fought us  some of the Democrats fought us  but we got that agency passed into law  It has now forced big banks to return more than 12 billion dollars directly to people they cheated  35 I served in the Obama administration  I know what we can do by executive authority and I will use it  In Congress  on the first day  I will pass my anti corruption bill which will beat back the influence of money  13   and repeal the filibuster  The third we want to get something done in America we have to get out there  6   and fight for the things that touch people's lives  3 I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law  I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law  but understand  22 Thank you  But understand this it was a dream big  fight hard  People told me   Go for something little  Go for something small  Go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept   19 I said   No  Let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy   5 President Obama said   I will fight for that   He sometimes  5   had to fight against people in his own administration  We have to  4   be willing to make good  2   big structural change  2  crosstalk 02 35 45    he called me out by name  0 People who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today  People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today  People who are getting stopped by the police  or paid less because of the color of their skin  are in a fight today  Anyone who doesn't understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who's likely to win them  For me this is about knowing what's broken  knowing how to fix it  Yes I'm willing to get out there and fight for it  37 Yes  0 You asked about a surprising friend  For me  it would be Charles Fried  27 years ago when I was under consideration for a job  he was someone who had been George Bush  the first solicitor general  a deeply principled Republican  And we didn't agree on much  I was far more liberal than he was  but he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class  And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job  I grew up out in Oklahoma  I have three older brothers  They all served in the military  Two of the three are still Republicans  I love all three of my brothers and there are a lot of things that we're divided on there are core things that we believe in together  We want to see all of our children get a good start in life  66 We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by healthcare  We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in  Look  people across this country  whether they're Democrats  independents  or Republicans  they know what's broken  They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind  People across this country  regardless of party  are ready to say no more  We want an America that works for everyone  2020 is our moment in history  It is a deep honor to be here  to be in this fight  I know what's broken  I know how to fix it and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done  That includes everyone  55 This is our moment  2 I was born and raised in Oklahoma  but I'm sure glad to be in Texas tonight  All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas  That was their ticket to the middle class  Me  I got my big opportunity about a half a mile down the road from here  at the University of Houston  back when it cost   50 a semester  For a price that I could pay for on a part time waitressing job  I got to finish my four year degree  and I became a special needs teacher  After law school  my first big job was back here in Houston  By then  I had two little kids  and when childcare nearly brought me down  my Aunt  Bea 00 14 53  moved in and saved us all  The paths to America's middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower  Today  service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders  Students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare  I know what's broken  I know how to fix it  and I'm going to lead the fight to get it done  73 Let's be clear about healthcare  and let's actually start where Vice President did  We all owe a huge debt to President Obama  who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America  and committed this country to healthcare for every human being  Now the question is  how best can we improve on it  I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost  How do we pay for it  We pay for it  Those at the very top  the richest individuals  and the biggest corporations  are going to pay more  and middle class families are going to pay less  That's how this is going to work  46 Look  what families have to deal with is cost  Total cost  That's what they have to deal with  Understand  Families are paying for their health care today  Families pay every time an insurance company says   Sorry  you can't see that specialist   Every time an insurance company says   Sorry  that doctor is out of network  Sorry  We are not covering that prescription   Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it  They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the copay  What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets  What's going to happen in their budgets  The answer is  on Medicare for all  costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals  and costs are going to go up for giant corporations  but for hardworking families across this country  costs are going to go down  That's how it should work under Medicare for all in our health care  58 Let's be clear  I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company  I've met people who like their doctors  I've met people who like their nurses  I've met people who like their pharmacists  I met people who like their physical therapists  What they want is access to health care  and we just need to be clear about what Medicare for all is all about  Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies  and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage  we're going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for all  Every healthcare provider is covered  The only question here  in terms of difference  is where to send the bill  45 I'm sorry  1 Let's be clear about this  People will have access to all of their doctors  all of their nurses  their community hospitals  their rural hospitals  Doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms  They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies  People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles  What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country  Insurance companies last year sucked  23 billion in profits out of the system  How did they make that money  Every one of those  23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your healthcare company  52 So let's start by framing the problem the right way  We have a gun violence problem in this country  The mass shootings are terrible  but they get all the headlines  Children die every day on streets  in neighborhoods  on playgrounds  People die from violence  from suicide and domestic abuse  We have a gun violence problem in this country and we agree on many steps we could take to fix it  My view on this is it's not going to be won and done on this  We're going to do it and we're going to have to do it again and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly  But here's the deal  The question we need to ask is when we've got this much support across the country  90  of Americans want to see us do  52 I like registration  Want to see us do background checks  want to get assault weapons off the streets  Why doesn't it happen  And the answer is corruption  pure and simple  We have a congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless we're willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster  we're not going to get anything done on guns  I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said  let's do background checks  let's get rid of assault weapons and with 54 senators  it failed because of the filibuster  Until we attack the systemic problems  We can't get done reform in this country  We've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change congress so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well conducted  So it works for the people  58 Well  I start with a statement of principles and that is in this country  immigration does not make us weaker  immigration makes us stronger  I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers  but also for their grandparents and for their cousins  for people who's overstayed student visas  and for people who came here to work in the fields  I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable  Down at the border  we've got to rework this entirely  A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist  a criminal and a 12 year old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values  56 I want to add one more part on this because I think we have to look at all the pieces  Why do we have a crisis at the border  In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering  We need to restore that help  we need to help establish and reestablish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives  We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically  We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back  32 Did you ask me  0 He said it  okay  Sorry  4 So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else  These are giant corporations that  shoot  if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country  they'll do it in a heartbeat  And yet  for decades now  who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators  who has shaped our trade policy  It's been the giant corporations  It's been their lobbyists and their executives  36 The way we change our trade policy in America is first  the procedures  who sits at the table  I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table  I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table  I want to negotiate with environmentalists at the table  I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table  20 And you ask the question about leverage  if I can just respond to that one  The leverage  are you kidding  Everybody wants access to the American market  That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America   You want to come sell goods to American consumers  Then you've got to raise your standards  You've got to raise your labor standards and you've got to raise your environmental standards so our companies can compete on a level playing field   We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country  We can use trade to help build a stronger economy  44 Yes  and I'll tell you why  What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States  it is not helping the safety and security of the world  it is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan  We need to bring our troops home and then we need to make a big shift  We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily  We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan  We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem and that means we need to be working with all of our allies  our European allies  our Canadian allies  our Asian allies  our allies in Africa and in South America  We need to work together to root out terrorism  It means using all of our tools  it means economic investment  it means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the state department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries  We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values  82 I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer  I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick  And I talked to people  we did  we talked to military leaders  American and local leaders  We talked to people on the ground and ask the question  the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the Generals comes through  Show me what winning looks like  tell me what it looks like  And what you hear is a lot of  inaudible 00 16 22  because no one can describe it and the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military  46 I have three older brothers who all served in the military  I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made  They will do anything we ask them to do  but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve  We need to work with the rest of the world  We need to use our economic tools  We need to use our diplomatic tools  we need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer  not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan  31 Yes  We need to work on every front on climate change  It is the threat to every living thing on this planet  and we are running out of time  Every time the scientists go back  they say we have less and less time than we thought we had  But that means we've got to use all the tools  One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools  I have proposed  following  Governor Inslee  that we  by 2028  cut all carbon emissions from new buildings  by 2030  carbon emissions from cars  and by 2035  all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity  That alone  those three  will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70   We can do this  49 We also need to help around the world to clean  but understand this one more time  why doesn't it happen  8 As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future  we can't make the changes we need to make  We have to attack the corruption head on so that we can save our planet  14 I think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher  I've wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in 2nd grade  Let's be clear in all the ways we talk about this  money for public schools should stay in public schools  not go anywhere else  I've already made my commitment  We will have a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher  33 I think this is ultimately about our values  I have proposed a two cent wealth tax on the top 1 10 of 1  in this country  That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to five  Universal pre K for every three year old and four year old in this country  27 Raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre school teacher in this country  Cancel student loan debt for 95  of the folks who've got it  11 Strengthen our unions  This is how we build an America that reflects our values  not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives  11 I mentioned earlier  I've known what I wanted to be since second grade  I wanted to be a public school teacher  and I invested early  I used to line my dollies up and teach school  I had a reputation for being tough but fair  By the time I graduated from high school  my family didn't have money for a college application  much less to send me off to four years at a university  25 My story  like a lot of stories  has a lot of twists and turns  I got a scholarship  Then at 19  I got married  dropped out of school  took a minimum wage job  thought my dream was over  I got a chance down the road at the university of Houston  and I made it as a special needs teacher  I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher  I could tell you what those babies looked like  I had four to six year olds  26 At the end of that first year I was visibly pregnant  Back in the day  that meant that the principal said to me   wished me luck and hired someone else for the job  So  there I am  I'm at home  I've got a baby  I can't have a job  What am I going to do  Here's resilience  I said   I'll go to law school   The consequence was  I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love  which is teaching  It let me get into fights  It gave me new tools  The reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up  I fought back  I know what's broken  I want to be in the fight to fix it in America  47 That's why I'm here  1 Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day  And anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president  I promise no matter who our candidate is  I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a democratic Congress  but all problems didn't start with Donald Trump  24 Donald Trump is part of a corrupt  rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else  We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness  We're going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change  25 We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone  I know what's broken in this country  I know how to fix it  and I will fight to make it happen  16 My name was also mentioned in this  0  crosstalk 00 15 03   1 No  No one is the party  1 So look  let's be clear about this  We are the Democrats  We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone  That's what the Republicans are trying to do and we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care  20 Now  I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend Eddie Barkat  Eddie is 35 years old  He has a wife  Rachel  He has a cute little boy named Carl  He also has ALS and it's killing him  And he has health insurance  good health insurance  17 And it's not nearly enough   crosstalk 00 16 11  important  3 All right  1 So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more  Middle class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care  And I'd like to finish talking about Eddie  the guy who has ALS  This isn't funny  This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying  And every month he has about  9 000 in medical bills that his insurance company won't cover  27 His wife  Rachel is on the phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company   Please cover what the doctors say he needs   He talks about what it's like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends  family and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses  20 The basic model of an insurance company has taken as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage  That is not working  13   for American across this country  2 Medicare for All will fix that and that's why I will fight for it  2 Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations  For middle class families  cost  6 And go up for corporations  For middle class families  total costs will go down  3 So  we have to think of this in terms of the big frame  What's the problem in Washington  It works great for the wealthy  It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers  and it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies  What it's going to take is real courage to fight back against them  These insurance companies do not have a god given right to make  23 billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system  They do not have a god given right to put forms in place so that people cannot  They want to deny coverage   crosstalk 00 24 50  35 We have tried this experiment with the insurance companies  and what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system and they force people to have to fight to try to get the healthcare coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need  Why does everybody  Why does every doctor  Why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms  It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients  That's what we have to fight  32 So  the problem is that right now  the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents  It's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders  We need to continue to have border security and we can do that  but what we can't do is not live our values  I've been down to the border  I have seen the mothers  I have seen the cages of babies  We must be a country that everyday lives our values  and that means we cannot make it a crime when someone comes here   crosstalk 00 36 02  37   cannot make it a crime when someone comes here  0 Yes  0 The point is not about criminalization  That has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart  7 We need  1 Well  and one way to fix it is to decriminalize  That's the whole point  What we're looking for here is a way to take away the tools  9   that Donald Trump has used to break up families  2 I'd just like to add on this  2 I think that what we have to do  is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration  We need to expand legal immigration  We need to create a path for citizenship  Not just for dreamers  but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas  We need to fix the prices at the border  23 And a big part of how we do that is we do not play into Donald Trump's hands  He wants to stir up the crisis at the border  because that's his overall message  It's  if there's anything wrong in your life  blame them  13 What you're saying is ignore the law  Laws matter  And it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge  who come here seeking asylum  That is not a crime  And as Americans  what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border  but not criminalize the  26   activity of a mother fleeing here for safety  1 I disagree  1 I'd like to have a chance on this  2 I'd like to be heard in this   Well  it is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win  I took on giant banks and I beat them  I took on Wall Street and CEOs  and their lobbyists and their lawyers  and I beat them  I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator and I beat him  I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected  Shoot  I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected  but here's where we are  I get it  There is a lot at stake and people are scared  but we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else  And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in  Democrats win when we figure out what is right  and we get out there and fight for it  I am not afraid  And for Democrats to win  you can't be afraid either  60 I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for  I don't get it  Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption  It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat  and we need to have the courage to fight back against that  And until we're ready to do that  it's just more of the same  Well  I'm ready to get in this fight  I'm ready to win this fight  36 He talks about solutions that are workable  We have tried the solution of Medicare  Medicaid  and private insurance  and what have the private insurance companies done  They've sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system  They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms  Why  Not because they're trying to track your healthcare  They just want one more excuse to say no  Insurance companies do not have a god given right to suck money out of our health care system  and 2020 is our chance to stop that  34 So climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world  It puts every living thing on this planet at risk  I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best  and that is innovate and create  So I've proposed putting  2 trillion in so we do the research  We then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America  That will produce about 1 2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan  right here in Ohio  right here in the industrial Midwest  37 And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world  Right now  for every  1  the United States  9   spends trying to market around the world  2   China's spending  100  2 Look  I put a real policy on the table  To create 1 2 million new jobs in green manufacturing  There's going to be up  23 trillion worldwide market for this  This could revitalize huge cities across this country  and no one wants to talk about  What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made up piece of some other part and say   Oh  we don't really have to do anything   That's the problem we've got in Washington right now  It continues  33   to be a Washington that works great for oil companies  just not for people worried about climate change  5 Wait  1 We need to call out white supremacy for what it is  domestic terrorism  And it poses a threat to the United States of America  We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism  economic racism  criminal justice racism  health care racism  The way we do better is to fight back and show something better  So I have a plan  for example  on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids  But we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race  So my plan has universal tuition free college for all of our kids  but also increases the Pell grants and levels the playing field by putting  50 billion into historically black colleges and universities  It cancels student loan debt for 95  of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black white wealth gap in America  62 For decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant  multinational corporations to help giant  multinational corporations  They have no loyalty to America  They have no patriotism  If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico  they'll do it in a heartbeat  If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam  they'll do it in a heartbeat  25 I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we're not going to do it that way  We're going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table  with small businesses at the table  with small farmers at the table  with environmentalists at the table  with human rights activists at the table  And then we're going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets  They want to sell to you  25 I'll finish  0 Is everyone wants to get to American markets  1 No  So the question is  2 We need to raise our standards  3 No  what this is about  0  crosstalk 00 04 23   I think he said Warren  3 What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers  American workers want those jobs  and we can build the trade deals that do it  People want access to our markets all around the world  Then the answer is let's make them raise their standards  make them pay their workers more  let their workers unionize  raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products  34 Right now  the whole game is working for the big multinationals  It's just not working for the people here in the United States  and we can change that  8 Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just don't understand what's going on  Look at the new NAFTA 2 0  What's the central feature  It's to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians  Americans  and Mexicans more money and make more profits  That's what trade deals have  25 I'd like to respond  1 Because it makes the world safer  The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively  and we need to say so to the entire world  It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculate  someone misunderstands  17 Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe  and what's happening right now with Donald Trump as they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons  the different ways that they can be used  puts us all at risk  15 You know  we talk about what's happening around the world  I have three older brothers who served in the military  I see that they would do anything  Our military is the best on earth  but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution  We need to use our diplomatic tools  our economic tools  and if we're going to send someone into war  we better have a plan for how we're going to get them out on the other end  29 We don't expand trust around the world by saying   No  we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon   That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this  At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations  expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world  has pulled us out of the deal in Iran  and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon  the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare  34 We have to have an  2   announced policy that is one the entire world can live with  We need to make that clear  We will respond  7   if someone else does  but not first  1 What  1 From the time I was seven years old  I had a dream  I wanted to be a public school teacher  but my daddy ended up as a janitor  By the time I graduated from high school  my family didn't have the money to send me off to college  My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost  50 a semester  20 For me  what this election is all about is opportunity  Every budget  every policy that we talk about is about who's going to get opportunity  Is it going to go to the billionaires  or is it going to go to our kids  Right now for decades  we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful  It has been on the side of the wealthy  That means it has not been on the side of everyone else  Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations  people living in inner cities  people living on small farms and small communities across this country  38 How do we beat it  We beat it by being the party of big structural change  Give people a reason to show up and vote  We beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country  not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it person by person across this country with small dollar donations  with volunteers  with people who show up and say   I have a stake in this democracy   32 I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020  I'll start to make real change come 2021  9 Thank you  It's good to be here   I think of it this way  Who is this economy really working for  It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top  It's doing great for giant drug companies  It's just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled  It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons  just not for the African Americans and Latinx whose families were torn apart  whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined   It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere  just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us  When you've got a government  when you've got an autonomy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else  that is corruption  pure and simple  We need to call it out  We need to attack it head on  and we need to make structural change in our government  in our economy  and in our country   The way I understand this is there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country  That hurts workers  It hurts small businesses  It hurts independent farmers  It hurts our economy overall  and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy  Now look  we've had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back  What's been missing is courage  courage in Washington to take on the giants  That's part of the corruption in this system   It has been for too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions  have been funding the Super PACs  have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington  Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people and that means calling out the names of the monopolies and saying   I have the courage to go after them    've had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now  and it's basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do  Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty  and that is to profits  and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada  they're going to do it   Here's what I propose for an industrial policy  Start with a place where there's a real need  There's going to be a worldwide need for green technology  ways to clean up the air  ways to clean up the water  and we can be the ones to provide that  We need to go 10 fold in our research and development on green energy going forward  and then we need to say   Any corporation can come and use that research  They can make all kinds of products from it  but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America   and then we have to double down and sell it around the world  There's a  23 trillion market coming for green products  We should be the leaders and the owners and we should have that 1 2 million manufacturing     jobs here in America  We can do this   Yes  I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All  Let me tell you why  I spend a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke  and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care  medical bills  That's not just for people who don't have insurance  It's for people who have insurance  Look at the business model of an insurance company  It's to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare   That leaves families with rising premiums  rising copays  and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need  Medicare for All solves that problem  I understand  There are a lot of politicians who say   Oh  it's just not possible  We just can't do it  It's    Have a lot of political reasons for this  What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it  Well  healthcare is a basic human right and I will fight for basic human rights   crosstalk 00 19 54   Let me just ask the Senator  I just want to add to Senator Booker's point of   and that is that the insurance companies  last year alone sucked  23 billion in profits out of the healthcare system  23 billion  and that doesn't count the money that was paid to executives  the money that was spent lobbying Washington  We have a giant industry that wants our healthcare system to stay the way it is because it's not working for families  but it's sure as heck working for them   It is time for us to make     families come first   I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive healthcare services and that includes birth control  It includes abortion  It includes everything for a woman  I want to add on that it's not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us  47 years ago  Roe versus Wade was decided and we've all looked to the courts all that time as state after state has undermined Roe  has put in exceptions  has come right up to the edge of taking away protection   w have an America where most people support Roe versus Wade  We need to make that a federal law   Sorry   So in this period of time that I've been running for president  I've had more than 100 town halls  I've taken more than 2 000 unfiltered questions  And the single hardest question I've gotten  I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl  And that is to say   When you're president  how are you going to keep us safe   That's our responsibility as adults  Seven children will die today from gun violence  children and teenagers  And they won't just die in mass shootings  They'll die on sidewalks  They'll die in playgrounds  They'll die in people's backyards  Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that   So what can we do  We can do the things that are sensible  We can do the universal background checks  We can ban the weapons of war  But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works  where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe  We need to treat this like the virus that's killing our children   So what I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done  You know  guns in the hands of a collector who's had them for decades  who's never fired  Who take safety seriously  That's very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly  We can't treat this as an across the board problem  We have to treat it like a public health emergency  That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country  whether it's politically popular or not   need to fight for our children   I do   I do  We are a democracy  And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters  Now we for far too long have had a congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country  They have made this country work much better for those who can make giant contributions  made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers  and not made it work for the people  Well here's how I see this happening  Number one  sure  I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the senate  But short of the Democratic majority in the senate  you better understand the fight still goes on  It starts in the White House and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the front lines come January 2021  We have to push from the outside  have leadership from the inside  and make this congress reflect the will of the people   Climate change   Thank you  It's a great honor to be here  Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a stage like this  I was born and raised in Oklahoma  I have three older brothers  They all joined the military  I had a dream growing up  and my dream was to be a public school teacher  By the time I graduated from high school  my family  my family didn't have the money for a college application  much less a chance for me to go to college   But I got my chance  It was a 50 dollar a semester commuter college  that was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl  And It opened my life  I am in this fight  because I believe that we can make our government  We can make our economy  We can make our country work  not just for those at the top  We can make it work for everyone  and I promise you this  I will fight for you  as hard as I fight for my own family   
Tom Steyer,Bernie Sanders' analysis is right  The difference is I don't like his solutions  I don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families  I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector  but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed  The answer's not for the government to take over the private sector though  The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again  38 Well  let me just finish because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump  I'm talking about doubling the minimum wage  cutting taxes by 10  for everybody who makes less than  250 000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs  Donald Trump stinks  He's incompetent  As a steward of the American economy  we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy  crosstalk 00 07 13  that works for American working people  27 Let me  can I say something  0 Wait a minute  let me go  let me go  1 Excuse me  I was called on  0 Excuse me  Amy  This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party  We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a Democratic Socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican  And let me say that I got into this race because I wanted to fight for economic justice  for racial justice  and to make sure we had climate justice for the American people  And I am scared  If we cannot pull this party together  if we go to one of those extremes  we take a terrible risk of reelecting Donald Trump  39 And that is something   I still have some time  And let me just say this  2 That is a risk that will hurt the American people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk  7 Okay  but I get to answer that  I get to answer that  4 They're out of time and I get to answer  1 Wait a second  2 I bought stock in a prison company thinking they'd do a better job and I investigated and I sold it  4 I get to answer this question  And in fact  since then I've worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state and we've ended it  I've started a bank to support black ownership of businesses  women ownership of businesses  and Latino owners of businesses  Because this financial service industry is prejudice  I have worked tirelessly on this and you know I'm right  You wrote the Crime Bill that you call  24 The Joe Biden Crime Bill  that put hundreds of thousands of young black and Latino men in prison  5 There's something going on here  1 I have worked for racial justice completely and that is an absolute unfair statement  6 It isn't a question of the American people deciding that we have too much gun violence  Everyone in America knows we have too much gun violence  The problem we have is that corporations have bought Washington DC  The gun manufacturers own the Senate of the United States  So even though over 90  of Americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase  we can't get it through the Senate  24 So the question you have to ask yourself is how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way  And there are two things  That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator to change who's in charge  to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz  But I am also   Senator Sanders is right  We need to win a huge victory across the board  26 Democrats need to go to the grassroots  I built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States  4 The way to win at the grassroots is tell the truth  2   and organize  1 That's what it's going to take in 2020  1 Every single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race  We're talking about education  we're talking about criminal justice  we're talking about housing  we're talking about loans  I started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry  basically to make loans to black owned  Latino owned and women owned businesses  We've supported over 8 000 affordable housing units  But more than that  I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery  Something happened  We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400 plus years in America  of African Americans  of systematic legal injustice  discrimination  and cruelty  but also of 400 plus years of contribution  in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint  68 Listen  1 Can I  Look  1 I've released my tax returns  1 That was easy to do  But I want to say something about foreign policy  3 10 years  I want to say something about foreign policy  which is this  We keep acting as if we're in the 20th century or the 19th century  If you look at the biggest threats to the United States  we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States  We're talking about climate change  which is a global problem where we need US leadership for countries around the world  In fact  Mr  Trump's policy of us going it alone  of America First  of having no values  no allies  and no strategy  is disastrous for us  The biggest threat to America right now  in terms of our safety of our citizens  is climate  and it's time for us to deal with it that way  43 Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership  3  NAME  0 Look  21st century warfare is cyber warfare  What we're having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now  The question you have to ask is  where's the commander  in chief  And let me say this  16 This isn't news  What vice president Biden said is true  He did stand next to Vladimir Putin  There was a hostile foreign attack on our election last time  and the president sided with the hostile foreign power  That's why I started need to impeach  That's what we have to do  We have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power  that commits cyber warfare against the United States of America  That's where we are  Where are all these patriotic Republicans who wave the flag  but when we're actually under attack  they side with our enemies  It's outrageous  That's why he should have been impeached  They covered it up  and I was years before these people  There's something wrong here  We're under attack  and they're not doing a darn thing about it  46 The biggest misconception about me is that it's somehow I'm defined by business success and money  6 My motto  every day I write a cross on my hand to remind myself to tell the truth and do what's right no matter what  7 I don't think there's any question  George  that after this week there's a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected  And I don't think there's any question  but that the only way that we're going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said  which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters  And that means we're going to have to appeal across the spectrum  moderates  progressives and every group  So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party  including specifically the black community  including specifically Latinos  If you can't do that  then we can't beat Donald Trump in November and we can't choose a candidate who can't do that  And I am doing that right now with 24  of blacks down in South Carolina  with high numbers in Nevada  That's what it's going to take is turnout  but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters  Someone who can pull  as Amy said  everything together in every single way we're divided  61 I have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate  and they're all right  everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the Republican party  and a million times better than Donald Trump  That is not the question in front of us today  The question in front of us today is  how are we going to beat Donald Trump  You were in the Clinton campaign in 1992  and the mantra was   It's the economy  stupid   Well  if you look at what Mr  Trump is saying  he's saying those words   It's the economy  stupid   I trust every one of these people a million times more  but we're going to have to take Mr  Trump down on the economy  because if you listen to him  he's crowing about it every single day  and he's going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy  stupid  And that's the issue here  It is not about who has the best healthcare plan  All the healthcare plans are better  a million times better  53 The question is  who can go toe to toe with Mr  Trump  Who can take down Mr  Trump  because he's the real threat to the country  And let me say  you have to have experience to take him down  This is not a question of he's a nice guy who's going to listen  We need people with experience  That's why I'm worried about Mayor Pete  You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy  and take him down on the debate stage  or we're going to lose  And that's actually the issue in front of democratic voters  I have heard this debate so many darn times  and I love all these people  and they're all right  If we win  we can get the right thing  Bernie  I am with you  If we win  we can get the right thing  Pete  and Amy  but we got to win  or we are in deep trouble  and we keep not talking about the facts  42 So  I did start the Need to Impeach movement in October of 2017  And my father was one of the people who prosecuted the Nazi war criminals after World War II  And that's part of the reason I started it  Because when you see something really wrong in the United States  you're supposed to stand up against it  and fight against it  And that's what I was doing  But he's been  the Republicans have rolled over  they've had a sham trial  they've refused to have witnesses  They've covered up the truth for the American people  And it doesn't matter anymore that he's a crook  and he's always been a crook  and he always will be a crook  Right now  what we have to do is we have to beat him in November  and we have to beat him because he's incompetent  and bad for the American people  And that's the case we have to make now  47 Is he a crook  I knew that two years ago  Is he going to be more of a crook  now that he believes he can get away with anything  Of course he is  But the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in November  and that's going to be based on what we can deliver for the American people  The fact that he's incompetent as a president  his economy isn't delivering for working people  The jobs don't pay enough for people to live on  We've got to take him down on the economy  and get them out of the White House as soon as possible  30 Well  let me say this  I agree with Pete Buttigieg that it's about judgment not tenure  What we're hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how America should be the world's policemen  And what we've actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world  So when we're talking about our role in the world and commander in chief  we have abandoned a diplomacy  We don't have a strategy and we don't have allies  39 And actually this view of the world  that our response should be military is driven by our gigantic military complex and ignores the biggest problem that we face internationally in the world  which is climate change  And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes  It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries  So in fact  what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending  700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend  70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education  46 Let's talk about judgment here   crosstalk 00 59 16   3 Okay  can I respond to that  David  0 Can I respond to  crosstalk 01 00 22   1 Sure they've been cheating  Look  what we saw Mitch McConnell do  not just in the Supreme Court with Merrick Garland  but across the board with federal judges  was refuse to allow President Obama's picks to be considered  That's why Mr  Trump has appointed so many federal judges  because in fact the Republicans refused to allow President Obama to get his due  and honestly  we're sitting here talking about do you have a litmus test  We all have the litmus test  Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman's right to choose  Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way on gun control  Every single one in this row feels the same way  39 There's something else going on  These Republicans are in control  They're stacking the Court for a generation with young right wing radicals  and we've watched it happen and the question is what are we going to do about it  That's where we are in the United States  and the question is  Actually Joe Biden's right  We have to go win a huge victory this year  and we're in trouble  And so the question is going to be  look at these people  who can pull together the Democratic Party  27 And let me say this  we have not said one word tonight about race  Not one word  Are you kidding me  We have the most diverse party  We have a very diverse country  We have a very diverse party  The heart and soul of this party is diversity  black people  Latinos  AAPI people  Native Americans and white people  But for goodness sakes  pull it together  We're talking about something different  The question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls  What are we saying  Everybody on this stage feels the same way about a woman's right to choose and economic justice  The question is how do we beat Trump  How do we take down these Republicans  And the answer is we've got to show we can take them down on growth  job creation  the economy  We send them packing and then we get all of this including beating the corporations  51 Let me say this  I disagree  Andrew  no  let me say this  I disagree with you Andrew  I am the person on this stage who will say openly  I'm for reparations  Something wrong happened  I am for reparations to African Americans in this country  and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality  In fact  three days ago  one of the leaders of Joe Biden's South Carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign  and the Legislative Black Caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign  Joe  I'm asking you to come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say  It was wrong  and I'm asking you to join us  Be on the right side  49 But wait a second  wait a second  Bernie  2 Let's not argue about polls  Bernie  this isn't about polls  3 Bernie  I appreciate what you're saying  2 That's right  0 Okay  let me say this  I've worked  Bernie  I've worked to end cash bail in California and it's gone  I've worked to end private prisons in California and they're gone  I'm somebody who's  our family  my wife and I started a bank specifically to support businesses owned by women  black people  and Latinos  because they couldn't get financing anywhere else  But I  Joe  I want a answer  Really  I think you should come over and disavow the statements that this man made that were openly racist  that were wrong  and the Legislative Black Caucus is against  I'm asking you to join us and do the right thing  38 Out of narrative comes policy  And we're talking about a lot of policies that affect Americans  broadly and disproportionately affect black Americans or brown Americans  But what I believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly  Because everyone's saying we can't have rules that are different for different people  but in fact we're here because we had rules that are different for different people  I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans  not just legal discrimination  injustice  and cruelty  but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries  Because I believe out of narrative comes policy  We need to repair damage that's been done officially  and pretending we're all the same is not accurate  We got here a certain way  Let's talk about Jim Crow  let's talk about Martin Luther King  let's talk about Barbara Lee  the congresswoman from Oakland who's one of our great leaders  and then let's figure out how to repair the damage so we can move forward together  82 Yeah  I got to agree with Bernie Sanders  I do  Senator Warren is right  Everybody wants to get into our market  and that's how we convince them that they've got to be right on climate too  That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way  Yeah  of course  we want to make things better for American workers  and it's absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy  we're thinking about it from the point of view of the American people  not of the American corporations  That's a huge positive change  And I agree with the senators on that  but there's something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy  We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani  and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world  57 So if we actually want to be the leaders of the world  the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks  that makes a difference  we're going to have to put climate first  and when we think about doing the wrong thing  the way Mr  Trump did with General Soleimani  we have to ask  does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing  It absolutely does not  26 Being all by ourselves  being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world  So in fact  the USMCA is something  that's the first step  but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying  Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers  but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal  29 The Republicans have a cruel plan and their plan is pretty simple  It's to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids  by cutting healthcare across the board  by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want  and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement  It's very simple  That's what Mr  Trump's plan is and it's true in every single red state  but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr  Trump  I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds  And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia  South Carolina  that is a triumph for every American  And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas  Nevada  Mr  Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country  It's not just that he does bad things  He doesn't understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future  mobility and justice  That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr  Trump  because he will never be able to imagine it  So in fact  what we need to do is have a new conception  a new dream of America  dream it and make it happen  Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together  We are in perilous times  I am asking for your vote  Let's rise together  105 I worked internationally around the world for decades  I traveled  I met with governments  I met with business  and I understand how America interacts with other countries  And you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts  And to me  I believe that Senator Warren made a great point  It isn't so much about experience  it's about judgment  If you've been listening to this  what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East  of failure  of mistakes  So the real question is judgment  35 And if you look who had the judgment  it was a State Senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war  It is a Congress woman  Barbara Lee from Oakland  California  who stood up against the original vote  who was the only person in Congress  So I would say to you this  an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we're looking for now  I agree with Senator Warren  we are spending dramatically too much money on defense  The money that we're spending there  we could spend in the other parts of the budget and it's time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we're trying to do and how to do it  42 I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens  But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows  is that there is no real strategy that we're trying to accomplish in what we're doing in the Middle East  Obviously Mr  Trump has no strategy  He is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation  But if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in Afghanistan  we know from the Washington Post that in fact there was no strategy  there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense  36 So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East  what are we trying to accomplish  I agree with Vice President Biden  to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries  And I want to point out that as we do that we're confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about  But at the same time there's a gigantic climate issue in Australia  which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building  that we actually should be using in the Middle East  We need to ask ourselves  how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans  where we can prosper more  And every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and it's just not happening in Washington DC  40 No  It's very clear that if we're going to do something with North Korea  we're going to have to do it in concert with our allies  That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere  that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get  But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense  And when you are talking about Iran  let's face it  Iran is under great pressure economically  So every single discussion we've had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran  Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us  putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic  That to me is called strategy  having a goal to make America safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world  57   Spending money  2 Look  On the first day  I would undo Mr  Trump's tariffs  On the first day  I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to  to oil refiners not having to use corn based ethanol  16 In fact  these trade deals have been exactly what Senator Sanders and Warren have been saying  which is that they've been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America  not for the working people of America  and not to protect the climate  17 So let me say this  I'm the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority  I would not sign this deal  because if climate is your number one priority  you can't sign a deal  even if it's marginally better for working people  until climate is also taken into consideration  16 Look  I've got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31  I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction  Everybody in their generation knows it  Frankly  Mayor Buttigieg  you're their generation  I'd think you would be standing up more  Look  That's why I'm standing up for it  We cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say   We're going to sign this one more deal  We're going to do one more thing without putting climate first   That's why it's my number one priority  We can do it in a way that makes us richer  but we have to do it  36 Look  We've had this conversation on this stage so many times  Everybody on this stage believes that affordable healthcare is a right for every single American  Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world  It makes no sense  and the government has to step in  22 I do happen to agree with vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option  but the real question is this  This is not a new problem  Why do we keep having this conversation  We have a broken government  It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies  the insurance companies  and the private hospitals  20 That's what I'm talking about  How do we get back government of  by  and for the people  How do we actually break the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed  11 Can I respond to this  1 I just want to emphasize what Senator Sanders said  This is not a complicated problem  Between what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders said  it's clear  There are two problems  We're spending way too much because corporations own the system  and we're not negotiating against those corporations and we've given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades  That's all this is  We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering  Senator Warren is right  This is cruelty for money  In order to break this  we're going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem  That's why I'm for term limits  We need to redo Washington DC  crosstalk 01 12 27  and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it  52 No  And let me say this  I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax  almost a year and a half ago  I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable  unjust and unsupportable  and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end  And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year and a half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need  But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because we're talking a lot about college  32 But in fact  if you talk about the Poor People's Campaign  you have to realize that for the youngest kids  they are getting an education that's relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods  We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance  So we're not legislating inequality for the next generation  And so  we actually invest in every single kid  specifically poor kids  specifically black kids  specifically brown kids  We need to start using the money dramatically more for that  30 Well Wolf  actually what I've done is to organize a petition drive of eight and a half million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office  And those eight and a half million people have called their Congress people  have emailed their Congress people and have actually dragged Washington DC to see that in fact  this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency  26 So  if you ask me whether standing up for what's right in America  standing up for the American people and our safety  standing up for the constitution  whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves  if you think that that isn't worth it  then you don't share the idea that I do about what America's about  Standing up for what's right is always worth it  Wolf  and I will never back down from that  30 Look  what you're talking about is what's called managed retreat  It's basically saying  we're going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and it's unbelievably expensive  And of course  we're going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble  But this is why climate is my number one priority  And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this  I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate  I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can't breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely  But I also know this  we're going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country  It's going to be the biggest job program in American history  43 So I know we have to do it  I know we can do it and I know that we can to do it in a way that makes us healthier  that makes us better paid and is more just  But the truth of the matter is  we're going to have to do it and we're going to have to make the whole world come along with us and it's going to have to be priority one  17 I absolutely am  Look  we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels  that we had to change  So I divested from fossil fuels  I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while I'm alive  And for 12 years  I've been fighting the climate crisis  I've beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws  I've stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard  California  I fought the Keystone Pipeline  I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully  35 So actually  yes  I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says I'll make it priority one because I've been doing it for a long time  7 Look  we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president  He's going to run on the economy  He's already told Americans last month in Florida  you don't like me and I don't like you  but you're all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control  So let's be clear  I started a business by myself in one room  I didn't inherit a penny from my parents  I spent 30 years building that business into a multi billion dollar international business  Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power  But whoever is going to beat Mr  Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he's a  inaudible 01 50 58  and a fraud  Look  Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey  I have 30 years of international business experience  I can beat Trump on the economy  We're going to have to beat him on the economy and I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage  68 I know that Iowans are going to caucus within three weeks and I want to tell you how I feel about the American people  Look  I played team sports my entire life  The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as I'm concerned  the American people are my teammates  And if there's one thing I will not permit  it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face  And that is exactly what I've seen over the last seven years traveling around this country  seeing these Republicans led by Mr  Trump  basically kicking the American people in the face  I am prepared to take on Mr  Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy  But I am asking for your support because I know that if I'm going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise  I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world  60 I'm over here  2 Judy  Judy  sorry  2 Well  let me remind everyone that I'm the person who started The Need to Impeach movement over two years ago  Because I believe what counts here is actually the American people's opinion  Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history  it's not a question of political expediency  it's not a question of political tactics  it's a question of right and wrong  So now when we look what's going on  I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar  The question here is  if we want the American people to understand what's going on  we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge  48 The court that counts here is the court of public opinion  The American people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath  so we can make up our mind  If we want Republican senators to do the right thing  we need their constituents to see the truth on TV  and tell them   Get rid of this guy or we'll get rid of you   That's what I believe in  I'm a believer in the grassroots  as an outsider  getting the American people's voice to count  That's who I trust and that's who I trust now  33 Let me say that I agree with Senator Warren in much of what she says  I've been for a wealth tax for over a year  I'm in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations  crosstalk 00 22 18  that this administration has put through  And in addition  I've talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income  which would allow us to cut taxes for 95  of Americans by 10   But there's something else going on here that I think is really important  and that's this  We know Mr  Trump's going to run on the economy  32 I built a business over 30 years from scratch  We're going to have to take him on  on the economy in terms of growth as well as economic justice  We're going to have to be able to talk about growth  prosperity across the board for everyone in America  My experience building a business  understanding how to make that happen means I can go toe to toe with Mr  Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure  And I think that's different from the other people on this stage  I think we need a different unconventional way of attacking a different unconventional president who actually went after the  39 Best prepared candidate in American history and beat her  3 Look  I am hoping that we in fact will do what I'm suggesting  which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency  I believe I'm the only person here who will say unequivocally  this is my number one priority  I know that we have to deal with this crisis  I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice  I've been working on this for more than a decade  I've taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws  I've pushed clean energy across this country  I've prevented pipelines and I've prevented fossil fuel plants  32 But I know is this  not only can we clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated  This is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle class union jobs well paid across the United States of America  Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we don't declare a state of emergency on day one  I don't understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead  Look  this is a generational question  I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage  I know everybody is worried about this  but for instance  I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher  Because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now  but it's also the greatest opportunity to rebuild and reinvent America  53 The point about nuclear power is  it's not at the stage in the United States where it's competitive on price  It has a lot of risks to it in terms of disasters and we have no ability to store the toxins that come out of it and last a hundred thousand years  We actually have the technology that we need  It's called wind and solar and batteries  So in fact  what we need to do  we can do  We've got to stop taking a look at this as something that we can't do because we can do this  and we can do it in a way that rebuilds this country on an accelerated basis  Creates millions of union jobs and we come at it from the standpoint of environmental justice  This is our greatest opportunity to reinvent this country  to actually take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together  You want to pull the country together with all this partisanship  Let's take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together as a nation  That's what pulls people together  54 Look  there is a temptation  particularly for this president  to try and answer that in a bilateral way  The way the United States should be reacting in Hong Kong is by gathering our coalition of democracy and freedom loving partners and allies to push back  In fact  when we're making moral statements around the world  it should not be us threatening and trying to be the world's policemen  It should be us leading on a value driven basis with the other people who share our values and want to change the world  34 We actually can't isolate ourselves from China  In fact  we have to work with them as a frienemy  People who disturb us  who we disagree with  but who in effect we are linked to in a world that is ever getting closer  And in fact  if we are going to treat climate as the threat that it is  we are going to have to partner with the Chinese  They are going to have to come along with us  They're going to have to trust us and together we're going to have to solve this problem  So the ability to say  27 It's off the table  We need a good relationship with them  We're going to have to work with them going forward under all circumstances  6 Listen  I'm running because this government is broken because it's purchased by corporations and I've spent 10 years fighting those corporations and beating them and building grassroots organizations to push power down to the people  That's what I've been doing for a decade  But let me say this  there's someone who's loving this conversation and his name is Donald Trump  19 We know how he's going to run  He's told us last week  he looked at a group of Americans and said   I don't like you  You don't like me  It doesn't matter  You're going to support me because the Democrats will destroy the economy in 15 minutes   We need to go after this guy  He's a different breed of cat and we need to beat him and we need to talk about prosperity  And I spent 25 years building a business  We're going to have to take him on the economy  not have these kinds of conversations and tear each other down  but actually go after this corrupt president and beat him on the economy where he thinks he's king and where in fact he's a fraud and a failure  37 Listen  I think it's important to note that this president is not against immigration  He's against immigration by non white people  8 This is his attempt to divide us  as Senator Sanders said  on race  And that's what he's been doing since the very first day he started running for president  He's been vilifying non white people  He's been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if in fact white people lose control of this country  that they're going to lose control of their lives  And as somebody who lives in a majority minority state  which is California  what he's doing is so wrong on so many different levels  I agree with Senator Sanders  We have to reframe this argument completely  We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right  This is a racial argument by a racist president who's trying to divide us and who's vilifying people  It's absolutely wrong and it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name  55 Look  the United States has made a commitment to treat everybody equally and that means supporting people with disabilities both in terms of education and later when they're part of the workforce  That means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that we're treating them fairly in school and after school to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible  27 The question we've got here across the board is can we afford to do the kinds of things that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are pushing  And the answer is yes  but in fact what we need to do is to undo the tax breaks that have been given for two generations to rich Americans and big corporations last year the top 400 corporations paid an 11  tax  That is absolutely ludicrous  27 the answer on disability is a question of focus and money as so many of these questions are  we have a country where the government is broken because corporations have bought it  They're getting their way and for us to get back to government of by and for the people that serves Americans  including Americans with disabilities  We're going to have to take that back  For the sake  21 So  look  this is the holiday season and what I'm hearing from every single one of these candidates is that they've gone around the United States and what they've seen from this administration and what they've seen from the Republican party is cruelty towards the people of the United States for money  So when I think about the gift that I'd like to give  and I've seen that too  I mean I think it starts with cruelty  When children are born and it goes right through life into pre K  education  health care  a living wage  there is cruelty to working people  there's cruelty to seniors  37 And so the gift that I'd like to give everyone on this stage  which was the original question  is the gift of teamwork  Because the question up here is  how are we together going to change this framework  How are we together  going to beat this corrupt and criminal president  How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together  Not by tearing each other down  but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America  And as a team that's how we're going to do it  And as Americans  we're going to come together to stand up for the original values  freedom  equality  justice  teamwork  48 I'm different from everybody else on this stage and here's why  I'm running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people  And for the last 10 years  that's exactly what I've been doing  taking on unchecked corporate power  That's why I'm for term limits  because if we're going to have bold change  then we need new people in charge and new ideas  I'm the only person on this stage who's built a large  multi billion dollar international business  I know how to grow prosperity  I can take on Mr  Trump on the economy and beat him  I'm the only one on this stage who said climate is my number one priority  It's a crisis we have to deal with  but it's also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water and the black and brown communities where it's so essential  So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold  beat Mr  Trump on the economy and solve our climate crisis  I can deliver  59 and I'm asking for your vote  1 What I've done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power  We have a broken government in Washington DC  It's been purchased by corporations  Over the last decade  with the help of the American people  we have taken on and beaten the oil companies  we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies  we've taken on and beaten utilities  we've taken on and beaten the drug companies  I've also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States  Last year  NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history  43 I also  in partnership with seven national unions  knocked on 15 million doors in 2016  and 10 million in 2018  What I've done is to try to push power down to the American people  to take power away from the corporations who've bought our government  And I'm talking now about structural reform in Washington DC  Term limits  If you want bold change in the United States  you're going to have to have new and different people in charge  I'm the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits  Vice President Biden won't  Senator Sanders won't  even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change  I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy  It's time to push the power back to the people  46 And away from DC  1 Since I was named  I'd like to chime in here  5 Thanks Andrew  1 When you look at inequality in the United States of America  you have to start with housing  Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life  It determines where your kids go to school  It determines the air you breathe  where you shop  how long it takes you to get to work  What we've seen in California is as a result of policy  we have millions too few housing units and that affects everybody in California  31 It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state  but it also includes skyrocketing rents that affect every single working person in the state of California  I understand exactly what needs to be done here  which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units  26 But the other thing that's going to be true about building these units is we're going to have to build them in a way that's sustainable  That in fact  how we build units where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability  15 So we are going to have to direct dollars  we're going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who've worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns  that they have to change that and we're going to have to force it and then we're going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50  of their income on rent  28 Rachel  I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me  Vice president Biden won't say it  Senator Warren won't say it  It's a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one  I would use the emergency powers of the presidency  I know that we have to do this  I've spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies  stopping pipelines  stopping fossil fuel plants  ensuring clean energy across the country  I know that we have to do this  I also know that we can do this  I would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well  43 We can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country  I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution  which are low income black and brown communities and when we ask how are we going to pull this country together  how about this  We take on the biggest challenge in history  We save the world and we do it together  If you think that would pull America together  I do  34 Can I respond to that  Rachel  1 I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels  Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels and we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago  If we're waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills  and I know everybody on this stage cares about this  but Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever  33 This is a problem  which continues to get worse  That's why I'm saying it's a state of emergency  That's why I'm saying it's priority one  If it isn't priority one  it's not going to get done  and this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront  We have to make it the most important thing and we can use it to rebuild and re imagine what the United States is  We can be the moral leaders of the world again  while we clean up our air and water  and create millions of good paying jobs  28 Well  I agree with exactly what Bernie said  but I want to talk about how we're going to win in 2020  I don't mean to change the subject  but I think it's sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020  but have a sweeping victory across the country  What that's going to mean is turnout  In the United States of America  the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us  when up to half the people don't vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth  no one deals with my issues  the system is broken  why would we vote  but what we've found at NextGen America  is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important  If you look at 2018  and flipping the house  what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three quarters in the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people  The turnout went up by more than a hundred percent  more than double  64 For us to win  for everybody on this stage  for whoever's the candidate to have a Senate that's Democratic  for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely are going to have next year   10  it's a turnout question  We're going to have to tell the truth  3  NAME  2 I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House  I stand by that statement  but I'm different from everybody else on this stage  I know that the government in Washington D C   is broken  I know that it's been purchased by corporations and I've spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations  I'm the only one on this stage who's willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself  term limits  that if we're going to make bold changes  we're going to need new and different people in charge  I'm the only person on this stage who's spent decades building an international business  44 Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr  Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy  talk about growth  understand that we can make Mr  Trump what he is  a fraud and a failure on the economy  which is his strong point  I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority  that it's our biggest challenge  but it's our biggest opportunity to recreate this country  If you want to beat Mr  Trump  if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government  if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants  I'm the person who can do it  38 I have spent a decade trusting the American people  3 I'm asking you to trust me  2 Well  Anderson  this is my first time on this stage  so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent  more coherent  and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House  But I also want to point out that Anderson's right  two years ago  I started the Need To Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  That we did have the most corrupt president in the country  and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong  not of political expediency  So in fact  impeaching and removing this President is something that the American people are demanding  They're the voice that counts and that's who I went to  the American people  48 Ha  2 Well  first of all  let me say this  Senator Sanders is right  There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government  and those 40 years have meant a 40 year attack on the rights of working people  and specifically on organized labor  The results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says  both in terms of assets and in terms of income  It's absolutely wrong  It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair  I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax  I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations  38 But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful  and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings  As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor  people haven't had a raise  90  of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years  If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation  you get 11 bucks  It's seven and a quarter  If you included the productivity gains of American workers  it'd be over 20 bucks  There's something wrong here  and that is that the corporations have bought our government  Our government has failed  That's why I'm running for president  because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants  healthcare  education  Green New Deal  or a living wage  46  NAME  3 Erin  let me say  this is a  1 Absolutely  As far as I'm concerned  Mr  Trump's America first program  which involves having no plans  having no process  and having no partners is proved to be a disaster in Syria  it's proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy  and more than that  when we look at the problems around the world  the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense  32 Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing  which no one has brought up  which is climate  We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves  It's an international crisis  I've been working on it for 10 years  taking on the corporations  But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world  So if you look at what Mr  Trump is doing  of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies  But any problem that we're going to do  but specifically climate  we're going to have to lead the world morally  we're going to have to lead it technologically  financially  and commercially  This is the proof that this kind of America first  go it alone  trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I've ever heard  and I would change it on day one in every single light  49 Well  I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America's had  72 000 people died of opioid overdoses last year  and that's not only a tragedy for them  it's a tragedy for their family and their communities  And so I think we have to treat this as a health crisis  We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people  but I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point  The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government  and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it  32 Every single one of these conversations is about that broken government  It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want  It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want  We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government  I've put forward actual structural changes  including term limits  a national referendum  the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically and make it a lot easier to vote  These corporations have taken over our government  and 72 000 deaths this year are the tragic result  35 Look  I agree with Senator Warren that in fact monopolies have to be dealt with  They either have to be broken up or regulated  and that's part of it  but we have to understand that Mr  Trump is going to be running on the economy  He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow  I started a business from scratch  one room  no employers  and built a multi billion dollar international business  We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies  but also talk about prosperity  talk about investing in the American people  talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector  40 In fact  if we want to beat Mr  Trump  I think somebody who can go toe to toe with them and show them to be a fraud and a failure as a business person  and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy  is going to be necessary  He is one  His tax plan's a failure  His trade war is a failure  I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show  22   I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that in fact he's failed the American people and he has to go  4 I'm friends with a woman from Denmark  South Carolina  MD  Ana Berry who's fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community  She's a different gender  she's a different race  she's from a different part of the country  But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism  And her honor  my mother was a school teacher in the New York public schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention  My father was the first generation in his family to go to college  My grandfather was a plumber  He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg  And when I asked him what that experience meant  he said   When you see something wrong in your society  you fight it from the first day and every single day after   And that's why I started the need to impeach movement two years ago  because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  51 And over 10 years ago  I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis  and I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully and that's why I'm running for president because our government has failed  It's been taught by corporations and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people  I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do  which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day  30 
Joe Biden,We talk about progressive  let's talk about being progressive  Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church  Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist  Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period   No  let me finish  A waiting period of 12 hours  I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths  but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared  In addition to that  being progressive  he thought Barack Obama  he wanted a primary  He said we should primary Barack Obama  someone should  And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it  Look  folks  let's talk about progressive  Progressive is getting things done  And that's what we got done  We got a lot done  55 Well first of all  the latest poll  I saw my numbers  I'm still 15 points ahead  The latest poll  6 But look  3 Well  it depends on which   Look  I've earned the vote  I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African American community  not just here but across the country  I've been coming here for years and years creating jobs here  making sure that the port  for example  that employs one in 11 people  we put  500 million in our administration just into this county  We've created jobs for people  The people know me  My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties  I don't expect anything  I plan to earn the vote  I'm here to ask  inaudible 00 11 16   But folks  I intend to win South Carolina and I will win the African American vote here in South Carolina  44 I will win South Carolina  2 No  0 There was a  0 There was a   I thought  2 That's the problem  1 41 0 Whoa  whoa  whoa  1 I guess the only way to do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should  Here's the deal  Here's the deal  look  A guy is a friend of mine down there named Fritz Hollings  the pastor  He said   You want to know what a man or woman will do  Look what they've done  Look what they've done   You talk about concerns about race  Well  my good friend on the end of this platform  he in fact bought a system that was a private prison system  After he knew that in fact what happened was they hogtied young men in prison here in this state  They in fact made sure that in Georgia they did not have health care for the people who were being held  They in fact went on  and he said  after he knew that he bought it  And then he said he was proud of his accomplishment  You talk about what we're talking about with Bernie  Bernie in fact  hasn't passed much of anything  The fact of the matter is  54 Look  the fact is  1 I'm not out of time  you spoke overtime and I'm going to talk  Here's the deal  Here's the deal  The fact of the matter is  look at what's happening here  Look at what's happening here  We have to win the Senate back  And by the way  I went into all of those races that got 41 new Democrats  The majority of them are supporting me for president  20 But you knew  you knew when you bought it they had done that  3 Where we come from that's called Tommy come lately  2 Tommy come lately  2 Look  0 Because I'm the only one that ever got it done  nationally  I beat the NRA twice  I got assault weapons banned  I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them  I got them eliminated  except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida  and it was not reauthorized  In addition to that  I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods  I led that fight  But my friend on my right and others have in fact also given to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity  Imagine if I stood here and said   We give immunity to drug companies  We give immunity to tobacco companies   That has caused carnage on our streets  150 million people have been killed since 2007  when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability  More than all the wars  including Vietnam from that point on  Carnage on our street  and I want to tell you  if I'm elected  NRA  I'm coming for you  and gun manufacturers  I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you  I'm the only one who's done it  59 Okay  but  crosstalk 00 03 01  votes to change that  We're going to beat Mitch McConnell  0 And  crosstalk 00 04 06   1 I wrote that law  2 I did write that  I wrote the bill  the Violence Against Women Act that took  4   out of the hands of people who abused or  3   Wait  no  Let's look at the fact check  1 The only thing  that the boyfriend loophole was not covered  I couldn't get that covered  You  in fact  as a Senator  tried to get it covered  and Mitch McConnell is holding up on his desk right now and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board  14 Two ways  Number one  my entire life  I've been involved with the black community  I was a public defender  I worked in the projects  I came along  and first thing I did as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  extended the Voting Rights Act  eventually for 25 years  and I've been deeply involved  In my first effort I had as a Councilman was doing away with redlining in the county  The way we do this  we got to help them create wealth  and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs  and black entrepreneurs are as successful as any other group of people in the country  We go from 1 5 billion to  3 billion  taking  30 billion off the sidelines  That's how you create wealth  Secondly  I provide for the opportunity for first time home buyers to be able to have a  15 000 tax credit  so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it  53 Thirdly  I go after those people who are involved in gentrification  because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense  They're being bought out  if anything  You can not find a place to live  And thirdly  I make sure that with regard to housing  we allow people  Look  right now  if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has  your house is valued significantly less than the white  The same exact house  We've got to deal with the institutional racism  29 I note how you cut me off all the time  but I'm not going to be quiet anymore  Okay  4 Look  one of the things we have to do  we have a thing in the defense department called DARPA  special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal with to make us safer  They came up with the internet  they came over the whole idea of stealth technology  I'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health  We're going to focus at least  50 billion over the first five years on focusing on obesity  diabetes  Alzheimer's  and cancer  and we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment  We can in fact find cures if we make the investment  And we can get that done  The American people support it  Even Republicans will support it  We have to focus on extending life  saving life  and making people  put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely  51 I wrote the drug court bill  can I  1 Can I respond to this  I wrote the bill that setup drug courts  3 Good idea  1 You keep promising me that  but you haven't done it yet  2 Well  let's get to it  1 What we did with Ebola  I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States  saved millions of lives  And what we did  We set up  I helped set up  that office in the president's office on diseases that are pandemic diseases  We increased the budget of the CDC  We increased the NIH budget  We should've  Our president today  and he's wiped all that out  We did it  We stopped it  28 And the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding  He cut the funding for CDC  he tried to cut the funding for NIH  he cut the funding for the entire effort  And here's the deal  I would be on the phone with China and making it clear   We are going to need to be in your country  You have to be open  You have to be clear  We have to know what's going on  We have to be there with you   and insist on it  27  NAME  9 No  I would not  and I'd spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office  This is a guy who doesn't have a democratic  with a small D  bone in his body  This is a guy who is a thug  who in fact has a million Uyghurs in reconstruction camps  meaning concentration camps  This is a guy who  You see what's happening right now in Hong Kong  And this is a guy who I was able to convince should join the Paris Agreement  Because guess what  They need to be involved  You can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are  36 When in fact  they said   We're going to set up a no fly zone  that you can't fly through our zone   He said   What do you expect me to do   when I was over there  I said   We're going to fly right through it   We flew B 1 bombers through it  We got to make it clear  they must play by the rules  14 Period  Period  Period  3 I've talked to Barack Obama  2  crosstalk 00 15 23  Look  Barack Obama was abroad  He was in a town meeting  He did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government  He acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy  but he went on and condemned the dictatorship  He went on and condemned the people who in fact had run that committee  He also made sure to make it clear  And by the way  I called to make sure that I was prepared to  I never say my private conversations with him  But the fact of the matter is  he in fact does not  did not  has never embraced an authoritarian regime  and does not now  36 This man said that  in fact  that he did not condemn  4   man said that in fact he thought it was  He did not condemn what they did  1 What did you tell him  2 How about Cuba and Nicaragua  2 Period  0 Oh  come on  0 Yes  0 I would make them pay for it  and I'd make them pay for it economic  they are engaged now  as I speak  in interfering in our election  They were engaged  when in fact  we were  the last election in 2016  against Hillary  They were  There's no question  This man stood before the whole world  turned to the Russian leader  and said   Why in God's name would this man ever interfere in our elections   Give me a break  17 intelligence agencies said he did  When we got the information  we went to the committee in the Senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them  We went to Mitch McConnell and said   Join us  and point out what is happening here   He said   No  we want no part of it   And if we had moved  we didn't have all the information at that time  until after the election was over  And so the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more  theoretically that's true  but the fact of the matter is  we didn't have the information  until the end  And so look  we in fact should be imposing sanctions on Russia now  for their interference  67 We don't have one  1 You don't negotiate with a dictator  give him legitimacy  without any notion whether he is going to do anything at all  You don't do that  Look what happened  He gave this dictator  he's a thug  legitimacy  We've weakened the sanctions around the world against holding us  committing people not to trade  benefiting from oil to parts that they can deal with  providing missile technology  And what's happened  It's been weakened  I would be in Beijing  I would be calling to  I would be speaking with Xi Jinping  I would be reassigning the relationship between Japan and South Korea  and I would make it clear  I would make it clear to China  We are going to continue to move closer to make sure that we can in fact prevent China  prevent North Korea  from launching missiles  to take them down  And if we don't  why am I stopping  No one else stops  60 It's my Catholic school training  2 Gentlemen don't get very well treated up here  3 When you get knocked down  get up and everyone's entitled to be treated with dignity no matter what  No matter who they are  Mine also that everyone should be represented  That no one's better than me and I'm no better than anyone else  The fact is what we should be doing we talked about the Supreme Court  I'm looking forward to making sure there's a black woman on the Supreme Court to make sure  inaudible 00 39 57   Not a joke  not a joke  I pushed very hard for that  27 My mother's motto was  she said   You're defined by your courage or redeemed by your loyalty   I am loyal  I do what I say  8 I have more hair than I think I do  8 In terms who can beat Donald Trump  NBC did a poll yesterday  says Joe Biden is best equipped to beat Donald Trump  That's what your poll said  And it said that I can beat him in those toss up states too  those states we have to win  I'm ahead by eight points across the board  So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump  I'm better positioned according to your poll than anybody else to beat Donald Trump  number one  Number two  the Mayor makes an interesting point  The mayor says that he has a great record  that he's done these wonderful things  31 Well the fact of the matter is  he has not managed his city very  very well when he was there  He didn't get a whole lot done  He has stop and frisk  throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall  And when we came along in our administration  President Obama and said   We're going to send in a mediator to stop it   He said   That's unnecessary   So we're going to get a chance to talk about the mayor's record  but in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump  look at your poll and what it says  33 I'm the only one in this stage that actually got anything done on healthcare  I'm the guy the president turned to and said   Go get the votes for Obamacare   And I notice what everybody's talking about is the plan that I first introduced  That is to go and add to Obamacare  provide a public option  a Medicare like option it cost and increase the subsidies  It costs a lot of money  It cost  750 billion over 10 years  but I pay for it by making sure that Mike and other people pay at the same tax rate their secretary pays at  That's how we get it paid  number one  34 Number two  you know from the moment we passed that signature legislation  Mike called it a disgrace  Number one  Number two  Trump decided to get rid of it  And number three  my friends here came up with another plan  But they don't tell you when you ask Bernie how much it costs  the last time he said that  if he goes on your show  he said   We'll find out  We'll find out how   or something to that effect  It cost over 35 trillion bucks  Let's get real  27 Since when Mr  Mayor  2 Didn't you call it  crosstalk 00 25 56  0 The mayor said when we passed it  the signature piece of this administration  it's a disgrace  They're the exact words  It was a disgrace  Look it up  Check it out  It was a disgrace   crosstalk 00 26 42  covered by the way  that plan you do not have surprise billing  You bring down drug prices  People are not   Give people all the things we're just talking about  I guess you're not got all the time to do it  but if I get a chance to talk  crosstalk 00 26 55  25 Yes  Let's get something straight  The reason the stop and frisk change is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on  When we sent them there to say   This practice has to stop   the mayor thought it was a terrible idea  We send them there  a terrible idea  Let's get the facts straight  Let's get the order straight  And it's not whether he apologize or not  it's the policy  The policy was abhorrent and it was  in fact  of violation of every right people have  We are the one  our administration sent in people to monitor it  And the very time the mayor argued against that  This idea that he figured out it was a bad idea  He figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop  Even then he continued the policy  51 Come on  0 Come on  0 Look  let's get something straight here  It's easy  all the mayor has to do is say you are released from the non disclosed agreement  period  We talk about transparency here  This guy got himself in trouble and he couldn't disclose what he did  he went to his company  18 No  no  I'm sorry  2 He went to the company and said   I want to be released  I want to be able to do it   Look  this is about transparency  From the very beginning  whether it's your health record  whether it's your taxes  whether you have cases against you  whether or not people have signed nondisclosure agreements  You think that women in fact were ready to say   I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me   That's not how it works  The way it works is they say   Look  this is what you did to me   And the mayor comes along and his attorney said   I will give you this amount of money if you promise you'll never say anything   That's how it works  33 If they want to release it  they should be able to release themselves  Say yes  6  inaudible 00 45 51   2 I'm the only one who knows this man and met with him  4 Come on  man  4 I've spent more time in Mexico than anybody  Can I get a chance to say something  4 Si  thank you  Look  I'm the only who spent extensive  hundreds of hours in Latin America  I've met with this president  I've met with the last president  the one before  13 It is the existential threat that humanity faces  global warming  I went out to check and you have a facility where you have the one of the largest  largest solar panel arrays in the world  And when the fourth stage is completed  you'll be able to take care of 60 000 homes for every single bit of their needs  And what I would do is number one  work on providing the  47 billion we have for tech and to making sure we find answers is to provide a way to transmit that wind and solar energy across the network of all the United States  Invest in battery technology  39 I would immediately restate all of the elimination of what Trump has eliminated in terms of EPA  I would secondly make sure that we had 500 000 new charging stations in every new highway we built in the United States of America or repaired  I would make sure that we  once again  made sure that we got the mileage standards back up  which would have saved over 12 billion barrels of oil had he not walked away from it  And I would invest in rail  in rail  Rail can take hundreds of thousands  millions of cars off the road if we have high speed rail  36 I'm willing to go as far as we have to  First of all  I would eliminate all the subsidies we have for oil and gas  eliminate it  period  That would save millions and millions  billions of dollars  Number two  I think that any executive who was engaged in   and by the way  minority communities are the communities that would be most badly hurt by the way in which we deal with climate change  They are the ones that become the victims  That's where the asthma is  That's where the groundwater supply has been polluted  That's where in fact  people in fact do not have the opportunity to be able to get away from  everything from  still asbestos in the walls of our schools  36 I have a trillion dollar program for infrastructure  That will provide for thousands and thousands of new jobs  not  15 an hour  but  50 an hour plus benefits  Unions  unions  being able to do that  And what it does is it will change the nature   Look  here's the last point  my time's going to run out  Here's the last point I want to make to you  On day one when I'm elected president  I'm going to invite all of the members of the Paris Accord to Washington D C  They make up 85  of the problem  They know me  I'm used to dealing with international relations  I will get them to up the ante in a big way  38 I thought I did  1 What would I do with them  I would make sure they  number one  stop  Number two  if you demonstrate that they in fact have done things already that are bad and they've been lying  they should be able to be sued  They should be able to be held personally accountable and they should   not only  not only the company  not the stock holders  but the CEOs of those companies  They should be engaged  And it's a little bit like  look  this is the industry we should be able to sue  We should go after just like we did the drug companies  just like we did with the tobacco companies  The only company we can't go after our gun manufacturers because of my buddy here  but that's a different  35 No  Taxes and small  inaudible 00 03 15   matter of fact  we're going to make sure there's more money available for small businesses in the Latino community  in the black community  to be able to get the capital to start businesses  At the Treasury Department  there's going to be a window available where we significantly increase the amount of money available so people can borrow the money to get started  They have demonstrated they're incredibly successful  23 We should not be raising taxes on them  We should start rewarding work  not just wealth  That's why we have to change the tax code the way it is  That's why the wealthy have to start to pay their fair share  And that's why we have to focus on giving people the ability to garner wealth  generate wealth  And that's why this whole idea of red lining  lending to people in areas  wasn't the cause of Wall Street failing  The greed of Wall Street was the reason why it occurred  not the red lining  29 And lastly  I want to say  look  the idea of China  China is and their Belt and Road proposal  they're taking the dirtiest coal in the world  mostly out of Mongolia  and spreading it around the world  It's clear  Make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days   If you continue  you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose tariffs on everything you're selling because you are undercutting the entire economy   28 Well look  let me weigh in on  you know  for 36 years and as Vice President  I was listed as the poorest man in Congress  I made money when I wrote a book about my son and it surprised me how much it sold  First time I ever made any money  and here's the deal  The fact is that we ought to start rewarding work  not just wealth  The idea that we have a tax rate for corporate America at 21  is ridiculous  It should be at 28   that would raise almost  800 billion a year  29 The idea that we have companies not paying anything at all  they should have a minimum tax of 15   that would raise another 740 billion a year  The idea that you're able to have a capital gains tax that you pay at the rate of 20  if you are Mike Bloomberg or whomever  and has a whole lot of money and someone else is paying  your staffer is paying at 25   is wrong  That would raise another  800 billion  We should be rewarding work  not just wealth  And the American people and the middle class is getting killed and the poor have no way up  43 You know  if you  inaudible 00 28 47  the point of personal privilege used to say  It was said that I was in the pocket of Mitch McConnell  I'm the only person on this stage that's beaten Mitch McConnell on four major  major cases  Let me finish  Let me finish  And Mitch McConnell  I've been the object of his affection and the President's affection  The way he's gone after me  this new Republican party  after me  after my son  after my family  I don't need to be told I'm a friend of Mitch McConnell's  Mitch McConnell has been the biggest pain in my neck in a long  long time and so that's number one  33 Number two  we have to have somebody who understands what it's like for ordinary people  Ordinary people come up  They have to understand  like my dad made that longest walk up a short flight of stairs  saying   I don't have a job honey  We have to move  You got to move in with grandpa   How long it took to buy a house  how long it took to get back in the game again  They have to understand the needs of ordinary people and they are getting killed  No matter what people say about this economy  how good it is and the good part of the economy   It's only 60 seconds  it's not up yet  and the fact is that we're in a situation where you have Mayor  excuse me  the President making clear that he doesn't want any part of me being his opponent  He's spending  125 000 00 this week to keep me from being an opponent  I wonder why  49 I was responding to an accusation  3 That's taken totally out of context  1 Did you ever win anything  2 Come on  1 Yeah  inaudible 00 00 30 55   2 Play by the rules  1 No  let the process work its way out  2 I'm running because so many people  3 Look  I'm running because so many people are being left behind  People I grew up with in Scranton when my job lost his job  lost his house  had to move  We moved to Claymont and we found ourselves in a position where we had little ability to get anything done  My dad worked like hell  I learned a lot  I've been knocked down a whole hell of a lot  I know what it's like to be knocked down  but I know we have to get back up  We have to provide some safety and security for the American people  23 Right here in Nevada the site of the most significant mass murder in American history  Guns  Our kids are getting sent to school having to hide under desks  learn how to run down corridors to avoid being shot  It's immoral  I'm the only one that's beating the NRA nationally and I've beat them twice  18 With regard to healthcare  it also is something that isn't right  Obamacare has to be expanded  It can be  in fact  cover everybody  8 Lastly  I think it's important that on day one we deal with sending an immigration bill to the desk  The only person in here has the worst record on immigration is Bernie because Bernie voted against the 2007 bill  13 Had  in fact  that  0   immigration bill passed  1   there would be 10   Six million members would be  2   now American citizens  2 Oh  they didn't miss anything  It's a long race  I took a hit in Iowa and I'll probably take a hit here  Traditionally Bernie won by 20 points last time  And usually it's the neighboring senators that do well  But no matter what  I'm still in this for the same reason  we have to restore the soul of this country  bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together  And so it's a simple proposition  It doesn't matter whether it's this one or the next  I've always viewed the first four encounters  two primaries  and two caucuses as the starting point  And so that's how I view it  36 Well  you know that with regard to Senator Sanders  the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate  We're going to not only have to win this time  we have to bring along the United States Senate  And Bernie's labeled himself  not me  a democratic socialist  I think that's the label that the President's going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he's a nominee  And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot  He's a mayor of a small city  who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to  and we'll soon find out  to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum  including African Americans and Latinos  41 Look  Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All  But Bernie says  and he says he wrote the damn thing  but he's unwilling to sell us with the damn thing's going to cost  The fact that we're in New Hampshire  very levelheaded group of people  look at the numbers  How much is it going to cost  Who's going to pay for it  It will cost more than the entire  the entire federal budget we spend now  more than entire budget  The idea middle class taxes aren't going to go up is just crazy  When they did it in Vermont  what happened  They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14  tax on withholding  And they finally did away with it  So how much is it going to cost  When you ask Bernie that  and I'll ask him again tonight sometime  and if you ask Bernie that  he says   Go figure  I don't know  we'll find out   54 I think that was on CBS  He said    We'll find out   Or something to that effect  Imagine you're going to unite the country walking into the Congress   I got this bill  It's going to require Medicare for everybody  I can't tell you how much it's going to cost  We'll find out later and it's likely to be double whatever   everything we spent in the federal government   Who do you think is going to get that passed  I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed  getting every Democratic vote  I know how hard it is  25 30 second  2 30 second response  My proposal gives you a choice  You're going to be covered  You have Medicare if you want it  you turn  inaudible 00 16 16  we're going to restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare  We're going to reduce drug prices  reduce prescription prices  reduce copays  et cetera  And it cost a lot of money  it costs  750 billion over 10 years  I tell you how I'm going to pay for it  I'm going to raise the capital gains rates  you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is  That'll pay for it  that's  800 billion  But here's the deal  the fact is that it's going to cost   Bernie's plan costs double  double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America  40 The politics of the past I think were not all that bad  I wrote the Violence Against Women Act  I managed the  900 billion Recovery Act  which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city  I was able to do it  I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban  arms control  And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage  So I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad  What happened  What is it that he wants to do away with  We were just beginning  34   Happened  what is it that he wants to do away with  We were just beginning  It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways  and there's ways to do that  and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done  and can lead the free world at the same time  15 I thank my colleague for saying that  It is a diversion  but here's the deal  Whomever the nominee is  the president's going to make up lies about  He thinks he has free reign right now  One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what we're going to do and how we're going to do it  And by the way  Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House  walked out  I think at the same time  he should have been pinning a medal on Vindman  and not on rush Limbaugh  And I think we should all stand and give Colonel Vindman a show of how much we supported him  Stand up and clap for Vindman  Get up there  Who we are  That's who we are  We are not what Trump is  52 No  And the reason I wouldn't have ordered the strike  there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him  Look what happened  his America First policies made America alone  You cannot think of a time  David  and as long as you've been alive when NATO has said to the United States of America and to Iran  made a moral equivalence and said  both of you stand down  We are alone now  alone in that region of the world  without friends  without support  without allies  32 And secondly  you saw what happened when that air raid  when those missiles were fired from Iran into Iraq at Al Assad Airbase  64 of our heroes were wounded  I don't know what I would've done if my son were still there  I would have been so damn angry  I don't know what I would've done  But here's what happened  they had received traumatic brain injury  What did the president say  He said   headaches    not bad    Headaches  that's all they are   This guy doesn't deserve to be commander  in chief for one more day  31 I'm not sure what she  if she wants to pull all troops out of the Middle East  but if she does want to put all troops out of the Middle East  we saw what happens when that happened  8 I helped put together a 61 nation group to take out ISIS by putting fewer than 5 000 forces along the Turkish border to see to it that they  and they lost 10 000  the Kurds  lost 10 000 lives  They defeated ISIS  They ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man I know very well  they've now  the guy running Turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a Democrat  and what happened  We pulled out and you saw what happened  You saw the end of the effort to be able to continue to contain  contain ISIS  number one  35 Number two  close your eye  everybody  Remember what you saw on television  You saw a woman standing up there holding up her baby  Kurd  saying   Please don't leave us   And our military women and men standing at  going out in their  inaudible 00 53 49  Humvees with their heads down ashamed of what they did  It didn't take a lot of men or men and women to do what needed to be done  20 And with regard Afghanistan  now I can say it because it was made public  I was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in Afghanistan  The only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region  I've been in every part of Afghanistan  not in combat like my friend has  but in helicopter and or on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president  Here's what I saw  there is no possibility of uniting that country  no possibility at all of making it a whole country  But it is possible to see to it that they're not able to launch more attacks from the region on the United States of America  That's a small footprint that we needed and I argued for that in the beginning  41 I made a mistake and I said it 14 years ago  I trusted George Bush to keep his word  He said he was not going to go into Iraq  He said he was only using this to unite the United Nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what Saddam was doing  When we got elected  the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said   Joe  I want you to organize getting 156 000 troops out of Iraq   I did that  I did that  25 The other thing I want to point out too is that NATO is in fact going to crumble if we don't beat Trump  NATO is in real trouble  We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security  We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before  It wasn't just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States  coming into Europe  It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world  to unite Europe in our behalf  I know how to deal with them  I know every one of these world leaders by their first names  They call me  I talked to them and I believe I can get it done  36 That's not what I said  I was part of the reason putting that deal together with Iran  I was there  I was involved in that  I was also part of the deal putting together the Paris Climate Accord  I brought in the Chinese  I was part of that  I've been part of every major initiative we've had relative to diplomacy  I have not argued for the placement of major numbers of US combat troops  I have said  along with the President of the United States  Barack Obama as his partner  I have said  we have to strengthen NATO to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them  Like we don't keep our commitments to the Kurds  We must keep our commitments when we make them  Otherwise  we have no power whatsoever  42 And it's not about making sure we're policeman of the world  The only way not to become the policeman of the world is to have allies who will join us in dealing with failed States and terrorism  And it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesn't require large number of US troops  and I've never said that  17 Here's the deal  The biggest mistake that Bernie made  that Senator Sanders made  he voted to give the gun manufacturers  the only major industry in America  a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating  First thing I'll do as President is work to get rid of that  It's going to be hard  Think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died  And I might add Bernie  while you were representing your constituency  an awful lot of people  inaudible 00 13 18  your gun state and they've come around  In fact  all those folks in California  New York  Pennsylvania  they're getting killed by the thousands during the same period  38 I come from a state that's a major gun owning stare  I introduced the first assault weapons ban  I in fact got it passed  I'm the only guy that beat the NRA twice  While I was pushing the Brady Background Bill to check background checks  Bernie voted five times against that when he was in the House  So look  the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did  I'm the guy that set up drug courts  I set them up  I wrote it into law and it never got funded  And also on opioids  I'm the guy who's already begun to make a down payment  In the Cures Act I put in  1 billion to fight opioid addiction  And lastly  my time is going to be up  surely  Here's the deal  Those Chief Executive Officer of drug companies  they should not only be fined  they should go to jail  48 We ought to be able to sue the gun industry  1 If you say the rest of what I said  I said that we're going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution  That's not a specific test  It's a generic test  And only way  the only reason women have the right to choose is because it's determined that there's unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution  That's what I said  And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan  who worked for me  we got onto the Supreme Court  I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court  I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in  I presided  and I'm the reason why this right wasn't taken away a long time ago because I almost single handedly made sure that Robert Bork did not get on the Court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights  inaudible 00 18 04   48 Let's get that straight  0 Yes  Look  here's the deal  Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution  A woman does have a right to choose  I would in fact  if they rule it to be unconstitutional  I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass  I believe  a bill that  Excuse me  legislates Roe V  Wade adjusted by Casey  It's a woman's right to do that  Period  And if you call that a litmus test it's a litmus test  but what I was talking about in the past  so no one gets confused here  is if there is no  If you read the Constitution very  very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights  If the doesn't say it in the Constitution that doesn't exist  you cannot have any of the things I care about  any of the things I care about as a progressive member of the United States Congress at the time  and as Vice President and as a member of society  52 I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's who I agree with  And I agree the way you deal with Citizens United is pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections  Period  Not private money  not billionaires  not money from special interests  Period  That's the way to amend the Constitution to deal with that  In addition to that  if in fact  Look  the Democrats stood up against the man I've revered  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  he wanted to expand the Court  But they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government  It says the President shell nominate  the Senate shall dispose  the Senate shall make that decision  not the president  He can nominate  47 That's why it's so important we must win back the United States Senate this time out  And that's why as you all look at it up here in New Hampshire and around the world  excuse me  around the country  you have to ask yourself  who is most likely to help get a Senator elected in North Carolina  Georgia  Who can win Florida  Pennsylvania  Minnesota  Who can do that  Because you got to be able to win those  Well  you can  I agree  But here's the point  You've got to be able to  you've got to be able to not just win  you've got to bring along a United States Senate or this becomes moot  39 I'm asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of that Black Caucus  I have more support in South Carolina in the Black Caucus and the black community than anybody else  Double what you have  or anybody else here  11 Well  that is quite right  1 This is not about polls  I'm not talking about polls  4 I've already spoken to Dick Harpootlian and he in fact is  I believe  sorry for what he said  But here's the deal  folks  We've got to stop taking the black community for granted  That's the starting place  Every one of the things we talked about here  for example  in South Carolina  Jim Clyburn  he has a program  10 15 30  We should be investing our money in those communities that haven't gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities  Make it a priority  We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense  they go directly  mandatory prison  I mean  excuse me  mandatory treatment  not prison  And we fund it  And we fund it  and three days doesn't get it  It takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress  We have to pay for that  53 Just like instead of building new prisons  we build new rehabilitation centers  We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses  You know  if you own a house  I know you do know  if you own a house in an all black neighborhood  same exact house in all white neighborhood  exact same shape  the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less  making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth  as my friend at the end of the line here says  So here's the deal  we have to do much  much more  That's what got me involved in politics in the first place  redlining  to stop it  39 I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement  I became a public defender  That's why I got involved  There's so many things we have to do across the board  and in education  at risk schools  We should triple the funding we have for at risk schools to provide for three  four  and five years old to go to school  not daycare  Increase the salaries of teachers  encourage more blacks to get into teaching  especially black men  because studies show when there's a black man in a school  it increases prospects significantly  and so on  There's a lot we can do  I've laid it all out as how to do  go to joebiden com  you'll see the whole deal  including criminal justice reform  36 I beg your pardon  0 Yes  I agree completely  There should be registration  automatic registration  turning 18  you get a driver's license  whatever you do  you automatically are registered  number one  Number two  with regard to what we're going to see in South Carolina  we're all going to be there pretty soon  We'll see whether or not it works  In response to the letter that the person  I'm not saying Bernie wrote the letter  but the senator who wrote the letter was very brisk and significant with other African Americans in South Carolina taking issue with her  29 But look  Amy is right  the senator's correct  That is that we  in fact  there is systematic racism  and that's why our Justice Department works so hard to go after those  You know  realize there are 35 states in the United States of America that have come up with a total of 78 laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep African Americans from voting  and brown as well  black and brown people from voting  And that will be an enormous priority in my administration as it was in ours  It's just wrong  simply wrong  39 Okay  thank you  3 I come from a family where our dad walked in one day and said  we've got to move  Don't have a job  We've got to move to a different city  I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others  who go through the same thing where the father's made that longest walk or the mother's made that longest walk  I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress  My net worth was net zero a couple of times  The fact of the matter is that I've never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years  It's not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others  but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here  43 These aren't someone else's children  They're all our children  They're the kite strings that lift our national ambitions  they really are  They lift our national ambitions aloft  We have an overwhelming interest  overwhelming interest in seeing to it they do well  You know  24 out of every 100 students in school today  from grade school to high school  are Latino  What are we going to do  Walk away from that  24 Many of them come from homes that are poor  very poor  That's why I invest so much time and energy in preschool  That's why if I only have  1 to spend  I spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day  than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating  A great number of them  as Mr  Yang said  aren't going on to college  although I think we should help with college  They're not going on to college  What they're going to do  they're going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades  the new opportunities  the new capabilities that are out there  We must focus on our children  Like I said  they're all our children  they're not somebody else's kids  Everyone  everyone  everyone  everyone  as my father would say  is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and we're not doing it  47 I said 13 years ago  it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war  if in fact he couldn't get inspectors into Iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon  It was a mistake and I acknowledged that  But the man who also argued against that war  Barack Obama picked me to be his Vice President and once we were elected President  and Vice President  he turned to me and asked me to end that war  I know what it's like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan  my son for a year in Iraq and that's why I do it very  very reluctantly  41 That's why I led the effort as you know  Wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan  We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of United States are at stake  They were not at stake there  They were not at stake in Iraq and it was a mistaken vote  But I think my record overall on every other thing we've done has been  I'm prepared to compare it to anybody's on this stage  25 I was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war  which I did  I led that effort  It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war  They said they were not going to go to war  They said they were just going to get inspectors in  The world  in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war  From that point on  I was in the position of making the case that it was a big  big mistake and from that point on  I moved to bring those troops home  26 I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran  bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us and it was working  It was working  it was being held tightly  There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon  And look what's happened  he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement  Trump  what exactly would happened  We're now isolated  We're in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran  saying both ought to stand down  making a moral equivalence  We have lost our standing in the region  we have lost the support of our allies  The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together  re establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement  which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done  56 I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf  where we are now  small numbers of troops  And I think it's a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS  What's happened is  now that he's gone ahead  the President and started this whole process moving  what's happening  ISIS is going to reconstitute itself  We're in a position where we have to pull our forces out  Americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank  I think he's flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed  38 Well  I'll tell you what  There's a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position  I was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror  as well as failed States  not us alone  68 other countries  That's how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS  They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us  with small numbers of special forces we have  to organize the effort to take them down  32 I ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in Vietnam  on the grounds that only way they can take a nation to war  is with the informed consent of the American people  The informed consent of the American people  And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere  excluding special forces  there's no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists  You have to be able to form coalitions  to be able to defeat them or contain them  28 If you don't  we end up being the world's policeman again  They're going to come to us  they've come to us before  they'll come to us again  So that's a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries  it's fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions  19 No  there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress House and Senate and signed by the President  That was the authority  does not give authority to go into Iran  it gave authority to deal with these other issues  14 Exactly  We tried that  2 No  not now  I wouldn't meet with him without any preconditions  Look  we gave him everything he's looking for  Legitimacy  the President showed up  met with him  gave him legitimacy  weakened the sanctions we have against them  I would be putting what I did as Vice President  I've met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else  I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea  to cease and desist from their nuclear power  make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons  I would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively Wolf  about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons  36 And when China said to me  when Xi Jinping said to me   That's a threat to us   I said   We're going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it   I would re ignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea and I would put enormous pressure on China because it's also in their interest for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist  But I would not meet with absent preconditions  I would not meet with the  Supreme leader  who said   Joe Biden is a rabid dog  He should be beaten to death with a stick   I count that  38 Other than that I like him and he got a love letter from Trump right after that  5 There'll be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalist and labor at the table  and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers  We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing America workers to compete in the 21st century on the high  tech side  dealing with artificial intelligence  We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that  26 By the way  the idea   I don't know that there's any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense  but the problem is that 95  of the customers are out there  So we've got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road  not China  15 We need corporate responsibility  and I agree with that completely  But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we made  enforceable agreements  That's one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico  and that's what we should be doing in any agreement we have  18 But let's get back to the basics here  If we don't set the rules of the road by going out to our partners  instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies  We make up 25  of the world's economy  We've got to bring the other 25  of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage  32 I agree women can win  and I've went in and campaigned for 27 of them  this last in 2018 the best group I've ever campaigned for in terms of competence  But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party  African Americans  brown  black  women  men  gay  straight  The fact of the matter is that I would argue that  in terms of endorsements around the country  endorsements wherever we go  I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race  34 I think we need to be candid with voters  I think we have to tell them what we're going to do and what it's going to cost  and a 4  tax on income over  24 000 doesn't even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as  40 trillion over ten years  That's doubling the entire federal budget per year  19 There's a way to do that  The way to do that is to take Obamacare  re instate  rebuild it  provide a public option  allow Medicare for those folks who want it  and  in fact  make sure that we  in the process  reduce the costs of drug prices  reduce the cost of being able to buy into the   subsidize it further  and make it available to everyone  Here's the deal  That costs a lot of money that cost  740 billion over ten years  I lay out how I pay for that  30 You can do it without Medicare for All  You can get the same place  5 The  inaudible 01 00 41  my layout does  in fact  limit drug costs  It allows all the drug companies to   Excuse me  it allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price  It's sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation  By the way  there's mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option  30 I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five Democratic presidents couldn't get done  and that is pass Obamacare  It was a big deal  Secondly  I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices  you don't have to pay the price  Limit what they can charge  If in fact they charge more than we set the price for  in fact  people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe  We in fact  It's only yellow  Okay  And we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers  if they don't like it or the employer gets rid of it  they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan  53 There should be free  universal infant care  but here's the deal  I was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed  My two boys I had to raise  I was a young Senator  I just hadn't been sworn in yet  and I was making  42 000 a year  I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington  Delaware over 500 miles a day  Excuse me  250 miles a day because I could not afford  but for my family  childcare  It was beyond my reach to be able to do it and that's why there's several things we do  33 When I tripled the amount of money for title one schools  every child three  four and five years old will in fact have full schooling  They'll go to school and after school programs  which will release some of the burden  Secondly  I think we should have an  8 000 tax credit  which would put 7 million women back to work  They could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an  8 000 tax credit  I also believe that we should  in fact  for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care  But Bernie's right  We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care  and I provide for that as well  My time is up  I know  but I'm not going to go over like everybody  42 It's irrelevant  There's no choice but for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move  He has in fact committed impeachable offenses  Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide  and by the way  I'm told that I say we have to unite the country  It's going to be harder after this trial  It may be  but look  you know  I understand how these guys are  this Republican party  They've gone after  Savage  my surviving son  Gone after me  told lies that your networks and others won't even carry on television because they're flat out lies  and I did my job  The question is whether or not he did his job  And he hasn't done his job  and so it doesn't really matter whether or not he's going after me  I've got to be in a position that I think of the American people  I can't hold a grudge  I have to be able to not only fight  but also heal  and as president of the United States  that's what I will attempt to do  not withstanding that we're going to be more division after he's defeated by me this next time  62 My response is back in 1986  I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts  they said it was a game changer  I've been fighting this for a long time  I headed up the Recovery Act  which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America  Look  what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately  If I'm elected president  I'll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration  which were taken down  that's 12 billion gallons of gasoline  barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately  And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what's already happened  We should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads  makes sure that we're in a position where we have   every new highway build is a green highway   inaudible 01 46 18  550 000 charging stations  56 We can create  and this is where I agree with Tom  we can create millions of good paying jobs  We're the only country in the world that's ever take great crisis and turn it into a great opportunity  And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa  by making them the first group in the world to get to net zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right away  There's more to say  but I know  25 I am prepared for that  Look  I've been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage  I've taken all the hits he can deliver and I'm getting better in the polls  my going up  And by the way  I have overwhelming support from the African American community  overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation  number one  Number two  working class people  where I come from in Pennsylvania and the places I come from in Delaware  I have great support  I have support across the board and I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all  And with regard to the economy  I can hardly wait to have that debate with him  Where I come from  the neighborhoods I come from  they're in real trouble  working class people and middle class people  When the middle class does well  working class has a way up and the wealthy do well  But what's happening now  They're being clobbered  they're being killed  47 They now have a situation where if they   the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that they've reached an economic security  I love that debate because the American public is getting clobbered  The wealthy are the only ones doing well  period  I'm looking forward to the economic debate  19 Character is on the ballot this time around  The American character is on the ballot  Not what Donald Trump is spewing out  the hate  the xenophobia  the racism  That's not who we are as a nation  Everyone in this country is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity  Every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency  It's about fundamental  basic decency  We in the United States of America can put up with   we can overcome four years of Donald Trump  but eight years of Donald Trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation  We have to restore America's soul  As I've said from the moment I announced  it is in jeopardy under this President of the United States  We lead the world when we lead by example  not by our power  52 We in fact have to regain the respect of the world in order to be able to change things  Ladies and gentlemen  we are in a position right now we have to remember who we are  This is the United States of America  There's not a single thing beyond our capacity to do if we do it together  let's go do it  20 You know  Judy  it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did  and Trump's response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now  I find is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do  Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling that's been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American  the American president  Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying   Stand fast   and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him  We need to restore the integrity of the presidency  of the office of the presidency  And it's about time we get that underway  My job  and I think the job of all of us up here  is to  in fact  well that's not true  some are going to be actually voting in the Senate  But my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesn't deserve to be president of United States for another four years  54 Well  I don't think they really do like the economy  Go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in  The middle class is getting killed  The middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that  You have  for example  farmers in the Midwest  40 percent of them could pay  couldn't pay their bills last year  You have most Americans  if they've received the bill for 400 dollars or more  they'd have to sell something or borrow the money  26 The middle class is not  is behind the eight ball  We have to make sure that they have an even shot  We have to eliminate significant number of these god awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy  We have to invest in education  We have to invest in healthcare  We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle class people so they can maintain their standard of living  That's not being done  and the idea that we're growing  we're not growing  The wealthy  very wealthy are growing  Ordinary people are not growing  They are not happy with where they are  and that's why we must change this presidency now  36 The answer's yes  The answer's yes  because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs  as Tom said  is real  We're the only country in the world's ever taken great  great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities  I've met with the union leaders  For example  we should  in fact  making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained  that it doesn't leak energy  That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where there's all kinds of folks out here  right here in California  We're now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining  We have enormous opportunities  For example  you talk about would we relocate people who in fact we're in a position where they lost their home  53 We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people  We have to rebuild the standard that exists today  For example  we shouldn't build another new highway in America that doesn't have charging stations on it  We have an opportunity to put 550 000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market  creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market  There's so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced  that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities  35 Yes  1 Look  I didn't say return to normal  Normal is not enough  In fact  we would have to move beyond normal  whether it's healthcare or the environment  whatever it is  we have to build on what we had started in our administration and that's been interrupted very badly  Number one  Number two  with Trump out of the way  it's not going to change things in a fundamental way  but what it will do is it will mean that we're in a position where his base is not going to be able to intimidate those half a dozen Republicans we may need in other things  33 I refuse to accept the notion as some on the stage do that we can never  never get to a place where we have cooperation again  If that's the case  where dead as a country  we need to be able to reach consensus  And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate  it's me the way they've attacked me and my son and my family  I have no love  But the fact is  we have to be able to get things done  And when we can't convince them  we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states  35 We attempted to close Guantanamo Bay  but you have to have congressional authority to do it  They've kept it open  And the fact is that we in fact think it's the greatest  It is an advertisement for creating terror  Look  what we have done around the world in terms of keeping Guantanamo open or what Trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in Israel  there is no solution for Israel other than a two state solution  It does not exist  It's not possible to have a Jewish state in Middle East without there being a two state solution  And he has played to all the same fears and all the prejudices that exist in this country and in Israel  37 Bibi Netanyahu and I know one another well  He knows that I think what he's doing is outrageous  What we do is we have to put pressure constantly on the Israelis to move to a two state solution  not withdraw a physical aid from them in terms of their security  And lastly  I think that  18 Senator Warren is correct  We have led by  not the example of our power  but the power of our example  And the example we're demonstrating now is horrible  It's hurting us badly  9 I'm going to guess he wasn't talking about me either  1 Look  I'm running because I've been around  All my experience  With experience  hopefully  comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom  The fact is that we're in a position now  the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things  Economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be used where we have to unite America and a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able on day one  stand up  look out the entire world  know who that person is  know what they stand for and know they know them  And that's the reason I'm running  I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage  36  crosstalk 00 03 14  Churchill  0 Oh  American history  0 I was joking  It was a joke  1 Politico doesn't have much of a sense of humor  2 No  I'm not willing to commit one way or another  Here's the deal  I'm not even elected one term yet and let's see where we are  6 But it's a nice thought  11 My average contribution is  43  number one  That's number one  Number two  the idea that the senator's suggesting that I'm in the pocket of billionaires  when in fact they oppose everything that I've ever done and continue to do  I have made sure from the very beginning  every one of my fundraisers is open to the press  Every single solitary one  not one single time period  And I've made sure that you know exactly where all the   and the largest contribution I've accepted is  2 800  which is allowed under the law  And I'm the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is now all public funding of elections  End all private funding  And we all should make a commitment of that right now on this stage  In the meantime  you got to fund a campaign and we in fact have funded a campaign average contribution   43  52 Not any  since I haven't spoken on this  Got a chance  Number one  the reason we're the country we are is because of immigration  We've been able to cherry pick the best from every single continent  The people that come here have determination  resilience  They are ready to stand up and work like the devil  We had a 24 out of every 100 children in our school today is Hispanic  The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral but as bad for America  They are the future of America and we should invest in them  Everybody will be benefit from it  Every single American and you should get used to it  This is a nation of immigrants  That's who we are  That's why we are who we are  That's what makes us different and we should invest in them  49 Afghanistan  you said  0  inaudible 00 23 25   1 The reason I can speak to this  it's well known  if any of you followed my view on Afghanistan  I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report  I said there was comprehensive policy available and then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation building notion  We set about rebuilding that country as a  as a whole nation is beyond our capacity  I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an anti terrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America  48 The first thing I would do as president the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home and into a negotiation with the Taliban  But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism  That's been my position from the beginning  That's why I think secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon weren't happy with me  26 Since 2009  0 Since 2009 go back and look  I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon   inaudible 00 50 08  I can speak to it now is because it's been published  It's been published thoroughly  I'm the guy  from the beginning  who argued that it was a big  big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan  period  We should not have done it and I argued against it constantly  23 I don't think it is realistic  but let me explain why  I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare  It remind everybody  20 million people got insurance  didn't have it before  All people with preexisting conditions are able to be covered  I could go on  We didn't get all that we wanted  but now that it's been exposed  that taking it away has such dire consequences  I've added to the Obamacare plan  the Biden Initiative  which is a public option  Medicare  if you want to have Medicare for reducing significantly the price of drugs  deductibles  et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about  750 billion dollars  And making sure that we're able to cover everyone who is in fact able to be covered  It  put your hand down for a second Bernie  Okay  48 I know  So look  it covers everybody  It's realistic and most importantly  it lets you choose what you want  Here you have 160 million people have negotiated their healthcare plans with their employer  Like many of you had  You may or may not like it  If you don't like it  you can move into the public option that I proposed in my plan  But if you like it  you shouldn't have Washington dictating you  You can not keep the plan you have  That's a fun  26 That's not true   crosstalk 00 57 46  1 I'm the only guy that's not interrupted here  All right  I'm going to interrupt now  It costs 30 trillion dollars  Let's get that straight   30 trillion over 10 years  Some say it costs 20 trillion  Some say it cost 40  The idea that you're going to be able to save that person making  60 000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous  16  of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now  Tell me  you're going to add 84  more and it's not going to be higher taxes  at least before he was honest about it  It's going to increase personal taxes  They're going to be  41 Thank you very much for listening  seven days out  Christmas  Thank you very much  Look  we all have big progressive plans and the question is  who can deliver on those plans  And it seems to me we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly  Who has the best chance  most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump  Who is the one who's most likely to do that  Number two  who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate  in States like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other States  34 And thirdly  who can deliver legislatively  That requires you to look at our records  I have a significant record of getting significant things done from the Violence Against Women Act and the Chemical Weapons Treaty in foreign and domestic policy alike  And so I think asking those questions  I believe  as you expect  that I'm the most qualified to answer those three questions  But most of all  we've got to level with the American people  Don't play games with them  tell them the truth and be authentic  God bless you all and may you all have a great  great holiday season and thank you guys for doing this as well  31 Well  look  the next President of the United States is going to have to do two things  Defeat Donald Trump  that's number one  And number two  going to have to be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places  and get a Senate majority  That's what I'll do  You have to ask yourself up here  who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place  to win the presidency in the first place  And secondly  who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the house  and in the Senate  And by the way  I learned something about these impeachment trials  I learned number one  that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee  That's pretty clear  42 He held up aid to make sure that while at the same time innocent people in  inaudible 00 08 11  are getting killed by Russian soldiers  Secondly  I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be president  So I've learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held  But the bottom line is  I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question  who is most likely to do what needs to be done  Produce a democratic majority in the United States Senate  maintain the House  and beat Trump  32 You know  we can do this without charging people raising 30  40 trillion dollars  The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all  It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats  It couldn't pass the House  Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense  We should build on Obamacare  provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here  adding a Medicare option in that plan  and not make people choose  Allow people to choose I should say  If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left  you have to give up your private insurance  160 million people like their private insurance  and if they don't like it  they can buy into a Medicare like proposal  In my plan  drug prices go down  premiums go down across the board  But here's the deal  They get to choose  I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest  and not demand of them what the insurance companies  they want no competition  and my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all  72 I think a woman's qualified to be president and there's no reason why  If you think the woman is the most qualified person now you should vote for them  The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is number one  I have brought people together my entire career  In the United States Senate  I've passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined  From the violence against women act  to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to did to dealing with Milosevic  27 The whole range of things that I've been engaged in my whole career  I've done it  I've brought people together  I'm always told by everybody on here  things have changed  You can't do that anymore  If we can't  I thought the question was initially ask of the Senator  how do you unify this country  We have to unify this country  I have done it  I have done it repeatedly and lastly to be commander in chief  there's no time for on the job training  I've spent more time in the situation room  more time abroad  more time than anybody up here  I know every major world leader  they know me and they know when I speak  If I'm the president United States who were four who were against and what we'll do and we'll keep our word  36 Look  I would not direct my justice department like this president does  I'd let them make their independent judgment  I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated  That's not the role of the president of the United States  It's the attorney general of the United States  not the president's attorney private attorney  And so I would whatever was determined by the attorney general  I supported  that I appointed  let them make an independent judgment  If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be in fact criminally prosecuted then so be it  38 But I would not direct it and I don't think it's a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say   lock him up   Look  we have to bring this country together  Let's start talking civilly to people and tweeting  The next president starts tweeting should  Anyway  it just  we look  it's about civility  We have to restore the soul of this country and that's not who we are  That's not who we've been  That's not who we should be  31 Follow the law  Let the justice department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted  period  7 Can I respond very quickly  2 Distinction  should he be impeached and should it be thrown out of office  That's one question  He's very close to impeaching  He's indicted himself  Number two  after he's thrown out of office or after he's defeated  should he be then prosecuted  Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president  That's a judgment to be made by an attorney general  21 Yeah  I was  I think it is the existential threat to humanity  It's the number one issue and I might add  I don't really need kind of a lecture from my friend  While I was passing the first climate change bill and that Politifact said was a game changer  20 While I manage the  90 billion recovery plan  investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we've ever done it  My friend was producing more coal mines and produce more coal around the world according to the press than all of Great Britain produces  I welcome him back into the fold here and he's been there for a long while  But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are  let's get this straight  I think it is the existential threat of our time  37 First of all  I would go back and making sure we had the alliances we had before he became president  He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea  He has given North Korea everything they want to create in the legitimacy  By having a meeting with Kim Jong un who's a thug  although he points out that I'm a rabid dog needed to be beaten with a stick  Very recently it was a comment  24 Other than that  I like him  And not in Japan and Australia and being a Pacific power  And putting pressure on China in order for them to make sure that it is a non  it is a nuclear free peninsula  And the way we do that is we make clear to China  which I have done personally with the president of China  and that is we're going to move up our defenses  We are going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea  And if they view that as a threat  it's an easy thing to respond to  They in fact can in fact put pressure on  36   to respond to  They can  in fact  put pressure on North Korea  But the fact is that we're in a position where he has done this across the world  He's embraced thugs  Look what Putin is doing in Europe  Putin is  his whole effort is to break up NATO to increase his power  look what he's done to it  This guy has no idea what he's doing  he has no notion how to go about it and we need a commander in chief for what he stands  Everybody knows what he or she  25 Yes  And I said it at the time  Khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and I believe in the order of the Crown Prince  And I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them  we were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are  There's very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia  And I would also  as pointed out  I would end subsidies that we have  end the sale of material to the Saudis  Well  they're going in and murdering children and they're murdering innocent people and so they have to be held accountable  41 And with regard to China  we should  look  unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights  we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China  What they're doing with a million Uighurs that are essentially in concentration camps in the west  We should be vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong  We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights  29 Yes  And by the way  it's one of the reasons  The first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization  which I wrote  The fact  I didn't write the reauthorization  I wrote the original act  The fact is that what happens now is that we in fact  have to fundamentally change the culture  the culture of how women are treated  That's why as Vice President  when I asked the President if I could start the movement on the college campuses to say   It's on us   It's everyone's responsibility  31 We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with  I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30 000 people were on the call  young people between 15 and 25  And found out   I said  what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and your schools   You know what they said   Get men involved  engage the rest of the community   And that's why we started this movement on the college campus is to fundamentally change the culture  29 No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self defense  and that rarely ever occurs  We have to just change the culture  period  and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it  It will be a big punch  no  I really mean it  It's a gigantic issue and we have to make it clear from the top  from the President on down that we will not tolerate it  We will not tolerate this culture  30 I'll be very brief  Number one  I think we should decriminalize marijuana  period  And I think anyone who has a record should be let out of jail  their records expunged and be completely zeroed out  But I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the long term effects for the use of marijuana  that's all it is  Number one  everybody gets out  record expunged  25 Secondly  I'm part of that Obama coalition  I come out of the black community in terms of my support  If you notice I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced from me because they know me  They know who I am  Three former chairs of the Black Caucus  the only black African American woman that ever been elected to the United States Senate  a whole range of people  My point is  24 I said the first African American woman  My point is one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship  longstanding relationship with the black community  I was part of that coalition  24 I assume when we're talking about the corruption of the federal government  we weren't talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress  One thing we haven't talked about here today  We've talked about everything  We haven't talked about the one thing I think is most consequential  The American people have an enormous opportunity  There's incredible   I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career and I got elected as a 29 year old kid to the United States Senate  Folks  we are in a position where we're the wealthiest nation in the world  Our workers are more productive than the workers around the world  three times as productive as workers in Asia  40 We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined  We're in a position where we've led not by the example of our power  but by the power of our example  I'm so tired of everybody walking around like  woe is me  What are we going to do  Let's remember  this is the United States of America  There has never  ever  ever been a time when we set our mind to do something  we've been able to do it  Never  never  never  It's time to remember who we are  Get up  Let's take back this country and lead the world again  It's within our power to do it  Get up and take it back  40 Yes  they have  I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background  what he did  all the accusations in the Mueller report  If they did that  they would have no choice  no choice  but to begin an impeachment proceeding  which gives them more power to seek more information  This president and I agree with Bernie  Senator Sanders  is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history  And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all  will not list any witnesses  will not provide information  will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment  They have no choice but to move  50 Look  my son did nothing wrong  I did nothing wrong  I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine  And that's what we should be focusing on  And what I wanted to make a point about and my son's statement speaks for itself  he spoke about it today  My son's statement speaks for itself  What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office  On the 17th   look  the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president  that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections  It was the greatest threat to America  47 This president on three occasions  three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections  The fact is that it is outrageous  Rudy Giuliani  the President and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying  What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump  He doesn't want me to be the candidate  He's going after me because he knows if I get the nomination  I will beat him like a drum  32 Look  my son's statement speaks for itself  I did my job  I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine  No one has indicated I have  We've always kept everything separate  Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware  we never discussed any  so there'd be no potential conflict  My son made a judgment  I'm proud of the judgment he made  I'm proud of what he had to say and let's focus on this  the fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption  That's what we should be focusing on  32 First of all  the plan we're hearing discussed is the Biden plan  the one I put forward  build on Obamacare  at public option  We can go into that  I can talk about that if you'd like  But here's the deal  on the single most important thing facing the American public  I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them  The plan is going to cost at least  30 trillion over 10 years  That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we're going to pay for it  The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs  but for people making between  50 and  75 000 year  their taxes are going to go up about  5 000 because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes  7 4  plus or 5  plus a 4  income tax  If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100 000 bucks a year  their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand  That is more than they will possibly say on this healthcare plan  We have a plan put forward that will work  65 No  look  Demonizing wealthy people  What I talked about is how you get things done  The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now  We have to start rewarding work  not just wealth  I would eliminate the capital gains tax that  I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39 5   I would double it  because guess what  Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make  in fact  pay a lower tax rate than someone who  in fact  is  like I said  a school teacher and a firefighter  It's ridiculous  and they pay a lower tax  36 Secondly  the idea that we  in fact  engage in this notion that there are there's  1 trillion   640 billion in tax loopholes  You can't justify a minimum  600 billion of that  We can eliminate it all  I could go into detail  had I the time  Thirdly  what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy  We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not  This is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy  Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given  The fact is  everybody's right about the fact that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is costing jobs  It is  The fact is also corporate greed  If they're going back  they're not investing in their employees  They're reinvesting and buying back their stock  54 See  I'm doing the same thing  1 No one is supporting billionaires  1 I would not have withdrawn the troops  and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq  which are in retreat now  being fired on by Assad's people  and the President of the United States saying   If those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in  they'll only go to Europe  It won't affect us   It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history  excuse me  in terms of foreign policy  And the fact of the matter is  I've never seen a time  and I spent thousands of hours in the situation room  I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places  in Syria and in Iraq  and guess what  Our commanders  across the board  former and present are ashamed of what's happening here  42 What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that  in fact  he's going to have a problem because Turkey is the real problem here  And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan  and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done  Now  pay that price  21 I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover  those thousand troops that are having to withdraw under fire  make it clear that they're not going anywhere  and have them protected  and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done  protecting those Kurds  They lost their lives  This is shameful  shameful what this man has done  23 I think I may be  doesn't make me any better or worse  but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin  as well as with Erdogan  And Erdogan understands that   You talk about should he stay in or out of NATO  He understands that he's out of NATO  he's in real trouble  But the fact of the matter is we have been one willing in this administration because we have an erratic  crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy  and operates out of fear for his own reelection  Think what's happened  The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO  What does the president do  He says   I believe Vladimir Putin  I don't believe our intelligence community   41 No  no  I'm not  No  no  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  0 I'm not  But here  look  but here's the deal  Think what that did  He turns around  and he questions whether or not he'll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members  If he is reelected  I promise you  there will be no NATO  Our security will be vastly underrated  under   We will be in real trouble  19 And with regard to regime change in Syria  that has not been the policy  we'd change the regime  It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds and thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border  And lastly  and I apologize for going up  but lastly  what is happening in Iraq is going to  I mean excuse me  in Afghanistan as well as all the way over to Syria  we have ISIS  it's going to come here  They are going to  in fact  damage the United States of America  That's why we got involved in the first place  and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians  39 He has no soul  0 I'm the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them  and beat them twice  We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years  Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred  The way to deal with those guns and those AR 15s and assault weapons that people own is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns  You must register that weapon  You must register it  When you register it  the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially  I'm the only one that moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it  I've done this  I know how to get it done  If you really want to get it done  go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued  That will  crosstalk 01 42 27   57 Because I've watched it  I know what the job is  I've been engaged  Look  one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience  With it  comes wisdom  We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage  command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies  and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track  It is required now  more than any time in any of our lifetimes  to have someone who has that capacity on day one  That's one of the reasons why I decided to run  why I decided to run this time  because of I know what has to be done  I've done it before  I've been there  47 When we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history  I've been there  And I've got so many pieces of legislation passed  including the Affordable Care Act  as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act which kept us from going into depression  I know what has to be done  I will not need any on the job training the day I take office  and I will release my medical records  as I have 21 years of my tax records  which no one else on this stage has done  so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing  34 Before the first vote  2 Yes  1 Before Iowa  I mean  look  I've released them before  I released 55 pages of my   I'm the only guy that's released anything up here  7 I would not get in a Court  pecking 02 23 13   We had three justices  next time around we lose control they had three justices  We began to lose any credibility the Court has at all  10 I want to point out that the justices I've supported   When I defeated Robert Bork and I say when I defeated Robert Bork I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to chose for a better part of a generation  I would make sure that we move and insist that we codify Roe v  Wade  The public is already there  Things have changed  I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio  Alabama  et cetera  who in fact are throwing up this barrier  Reproductive rights are a constitutional right  In fact every woman should have that right  I would not pack the Court  What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the Court  from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan  who used to work for me  to others  that they in fact support the right of privacy  On which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based  That's what I would do  No one would get on the Court   57 By the way  if in fact at the end of this   The beginning of next year  if in fact one of the justices steps down  God forbid  in fact I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out  We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice  18 Well I think there vision is attracting a lot of people  I think a lot of what they have to say is really important  But as Senator Warren said   We can't be running any vague campaigns   We got to level with people  We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do  how we're going to get it done  If you can get it done  19 I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here but I'm the only one on this stage that's gotten anything really big done  From the Violence Against Women Act  to making sure that we passed the Affordable Care Act  to be in a position where we in fact took almost a 90 billion dollar act that kept us from going into a depression  putting us in a position where I was able to end Roe   Excuse me  able to end the issue of gun sales  in terms of assault weapons  The question is who is best prepared  We all have good ideas  The question is who's going to be able to get it done  How can you get it done  37 I'm not suggesting they can't but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at  Part of that requires you not being vague  Tell people what it's going to cost  how you're going to do it  and why you're going to do it  That's the way to get it done  Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade  18 Well the senator said   She's being vague on the issue of   Actually both of them are being vague on the issue of the Medicare for all  Now look  here's the deal  come on it costs 30 trillion dollars  Guess what  That's over three trillion dollars a year  It's part of the entire budget  Let me finish  okay  20 If you eliminated the entire Pentagon  every single thing  Planes  ship  troop  the building  everything  satellites  it would get you and pay for a total of four months  Four months  Where do you get the rest  Where's it come from  17 We can do that without Medicare for all  We can do that by adding a  crosstalk 02 31 22  public option  We can  7 We can afford to do it  We can afford  1 By the way  1   the greed and the profiteering  0 Let me finish  2 The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies  they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else's  They were strongly against Obamacare  They know it cost them  It's going to take away the right of people to choose  The 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it  They should have a right to keep it  20 I agreed with   Let me   She referenced me  1 I agreed with the great job she did  I went on the floor and got you votes  I got votes for that bill  I convinced people for it  so let's get those things straight too  13 You did a hell of a job in your job  2 Not me  0  crosstalk 02 35 43  I did not say back to normal  1 This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle  get things done  No other way to get anything done in this country  The two people maybe that surprised you the most were  he's been mentioned twice  but John McCain  John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was assigned to me to travel around the world  We became close friends  became very close friends with my wife  Jill  Visited our home  He was there with his children and on his deathbed  he asked me to do his eulogy  I would say to John   John  you didn't see a war  You never wanted a fight   And he'd say   You didn't see a problem  You'd never wanted to solve   But he was a great man of principle  He was honorable  he was honorable  43 And one of the things  that's the reason why I'm running  we have to restore the soul of this country  That's why I'm doing this  In fact  this president has ripped the soul out of this country  divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous  a liar  He cheats  He does not do anything to promote people generally  Secondly  we have to rebuild the middle class and the only we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle  My dad used to say   A job's about a lot more than a paycheck  Joey  It's about your dignity   We have to restore people's dignity  And lastly  we have to unite the country because folks  it's time we stop walking around with our heads down  We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century  40 So for God's sake  get up  get up  and remember  this is the United States of America  There's nothing  nothing we're unable to do when we decide we're going to do it  Nothing at all  period  13 I will be a president for every American  3 You know  when President Kennedy announced the moon shot  he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life  He said   We're doing it because we refused to postpone   Well  I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer  Alzheimer's  and other diseases  which if we invest in them  we can find cures  I refuse to postpone giving every single child in America  no matter their zip code  pre K all the way through high school and beyond  I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change  and leading the world in taking on climate change  Look  this is the United States of America  There has never been a single  solitary time when we've set our mind to something that we've not been able to do it  We're walking around with our heads down  like   Woe is me   We're the best equipped nation in the world to take this on  It's no longer time to postpone  We should get moving  There's enormous  enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump  66 That'll be for the voters to decide that question  Let me tell you what I think  I think we should have a debate on health care  I know that the senator says she's for Bernie  Well  I'm for Barack  I think the Obamacare worked  I think the way in which we add to it  replace everything that's been cut  add a public option  Guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance  number one  24 Number two  I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are  My plan for health care costs a lot of money  It costs  740 billion  It doesn't cost  30 trillion   3 4 trillion a year  it turns out  is twice what the entire federal budget is  That's before it exists now  without interest on the debt  How are we going to pay for it  I want to hear tonight how that's happened  26 As far as my distinguished friend  the senator on my left  has not indicated how she pays for it  The senator has in fact come forward and said how he's going to pay for it  but it gets him about halfway there  There's a lot of other things that need to be done  I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools  that are title one schools  from  15 to  45 billion a year  I go down the line  and each of the things we're talking about  I lay out how I can pay for it  how I can get it done  and why it's better  33 Okay  Number one  my healthcare plan does significantly cut the cost  The largest out of pocket payment you'll pay is  1 000  You'll be able to get into a  Anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare type option we have  et cetera  but guess what  Of the 160 million people who liked their health care now  they can keep it  If they don't like it  they can leave  Number one  23 Number two  The fact of the matter is  we're in a situation where  if you noticed  he hadn't answered the question  This is about candor  honesty  big ideas  Let's have a big idea  The tax of 2  the senator's talking about  That raises about  3 billion  Guess what  That leaves you about  28 billion short  The senator said before  it's going to cost you in your pay  There will be a deductible in your paycheck  The middle class person  someone making 60 grand for three kids  they're going to end up paying  5 000 more  They're going to end up paying 4  more on their income tax  That's a reality  Now  it's not a bad idea  if you like it  I don't like it  36 This is America  1 149 million  1 15 seconds  2 15 seconds  Look  everybody says we want an option  The option I'm proposing is a Medicare for All in a Medicare for choice  If you want Medicare  if you lose the job from your employer  you automatically can buy into this  You don't have no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in  You get covered  Period  And if you notice  nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer  I hear this large savings  My friend from Vermont thinks that employer's going to give you back if negotiate his union all these years  got to cut wages because you've got insurance  They're going to give back that money to the employee  40 Well  let me tell you something  for a socialist you got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do  6 I know a lot about cancer  Let me tell you something  It's personal to me  Let me tell you something  Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan  They will not go bankrupt because of that  They will not go bankrupt because of that  They can join immediately  and we're talking four  six  eight  10 years  depending on you talk about  before we get to Medicare for All  Come on  I've been there  You've been there  You know what it's like  People need help now  hope now  and do something now  32 This is the  crosstalk 00 34 46  plan  1 They do not have to buy in  They do not have to buy in  3 They do not have to buy in if they can't afford it  0 Your grandmother would not have to buy in  If she qualified for Medicaid  she'd automatically be in for it  1 I said anyone  like your grandmother  who has no money  you're automatically enrolled  3 That'll be a surprise to him  2 Well  first of all  let me say that when I came back from law school I had a job with a big time law firm  I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege  When Dr  King was assassinated we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months  I've been involved from the beginning  As a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood  I made sure that we dealt with redlining  Banks should have to lend where they operate  etc  The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail  The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change  We should be talking about rehabilitation  Nobody should be in jail for a non violent crime  When we were in the White House we released 36000 people from the federal prison system  Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem  55 They should be going directly to a rehabilitation  We build more rehabilitation centers  not prisons  I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system  So we have to change the whole way we look at this  and we put people in prison  we have to equip them when they get out  Nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldn't be in there for a misdemeanor  That should be a misdemeanor  they should be out and their record should be expunged  Every single right should be returned  When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote  but have access to Pell Grants  have access to be able to get housing  have access to be able to move along the way  I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines  and the fact is we've learned so much more about  45 Thank you  1 Because I've got it done before  I'm the only one up here who's ever beat the NRA  Only one to ever beat the NRA nationally  I'm the guy that brought the Brady Bill into focus and became law  So that's number one  Number two  after Sandy Hook a number of things happened  It's went from a cause to a movement  Look what's happened now  Mothers  the organization  Mothers Against Gun Violence  We've seen what's happened again  Now we have all these young people marching on Washington  making sure that things are going to change  There has been a sea change  Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50  of members of the NRA supporting them  and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them  Now the numbers are much higher  because they realize what I've been saying  and we've all been saying  is correct  Over 90  of the American people think we have to get assault weapons   51 Correct  Over 90  of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street  period  And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements  So the point is things have changed and things have changed a lot and now what's happening is  and by the way  the way Beto handled  excuse me for saying Beto congressman  16 The way he handled what happened in his home town is meaningful  The look in the eyes of those people to see those kids  to understand those parents  to understand the heartache  we are ready to do this  12 Some things you can  many things you can't  3 That's not constitutional  We got a constitution  5 What I said was speak to constitutional scholars  If in fact we could say   By the way  you can't own the following weapons period  It cannot be sold anymore   Check with constitutional scholars  14 What Latinos should look at is comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous  Number one  we didn't lock people up in cages  We didn't separate families  We didn't do all of those things  number one  Number two  this is the president who came along with the DACA program  no one had ever done that before  the president sent legislation to desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America  This is the president has done a great deal  so I'm proud to have served with him  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed  37 I would in fact make sure that we immediately surge to the border  All those people are seeking asylum  they deserve to be heard  That's who we are  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression  you should come  I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum  And by the way  retrospectively  you know the 25th anniversary of the violence against women act is up  The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it  Let's put pressure on them to pass the violence against women act now  35 The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time  4 I'm the vice president of the United States  3 That's not what I said  That's not what I said  1 I did not say don't stand  I stand with Barack Obama all eight years  Good  bad  and indifferent  That's where I stand  I did not say I did not stand with him  11 Yeah  well look  we're either going to make the policy or China's going to make the rules of the road  We make up 25  of the world economy  We need another 25  to join us  and I think Senator Warren is correct  At the table has to be labor  and at the table have to be environmentalists  21 The fact of the matter is  China  the problem isn't the trade deficit  The problem is they're stealing our intellectual property  The problem is they're violating the WTO  They're dumping steel on us  That's a different issue than whether or not they're dumping agricultural products on us  16 In addition to that  we're in a position where if we don't set the rules  we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules  And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway  15 No  it wasn't wrong to pull out  but I want to answer the Afghanistan question  I've been in and out of Afghanistan  not with a gun  and I admire my friend for his service  but I've been in and out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this   And it's an open secret  You reported a long time ago  George  that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan  The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency  meaning that we're going to put that country together  It can not be put together  Let me say it again  it will not be put together  It's three different countries  Pakistan owns the three counties   the three provinces in the east  There are not any part of the  inaudible 00 20 37  run it  I will go on and on  40 But here's the point  The point is that it's a counter terrorism strategy  We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases  insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from  and to move against what we know  We don't need those troops there  I would bring them home  And Joe Dunford's a fine guy  but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years  25 With regard to Iraq  the fact of the matter is that I should've never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do  The AUMF was designed  he said  to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing  to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons  And when that happened  he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof  30 I said something that was not meant the way I said it  I said from that point on what I was argued against in the beginning  once he started to put the troops in  was that  in fact  we were doing it the wrong way  There was no plan  We should not be engaged  We didn't have the people with us  We didn't have our aligned   We didn't have allies with us  etc  And it was later when we came into office  that Barack  the president  turned to me and said   Joe    when they said we got to plan to get out  he turned to the whole security  and said   Joe will organize this  Get the troops home   32 My son spent a year in Iraq  and I understand  and we were right to get the combat troops out  The big mistake that was made  which we predicted  was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from moving in  Now  21 You're right  1 Well they have to deal with the   Look  there is institutional segregation in this country  From the time I got involved I started dealing with that  Redlining banks  Making sure that we are in a position where   Look  we talk about education  I propose that what we take is those very poor schools  the Title 1 schools  triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year  Give every single teacher a raise so they equal raise of getting out of the  60 000 level  27 Number two  make sure that we bring into help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home  The problems that come from home  We have one school psychologist for every 1 500 kids in America today  It's crazy  The teachers are   I'm married to a teacher  My deceased wife is a teacher  They have every problem coming to them  We make sure that every single child does in fact have three  four  and five year olds go to school  School  Not daycare  school  We bring social workers into homes and parents  to help them deal with how to raise their children  33 It's not that they don't want to help  They don't know quite what to do  Play the radio  Make sure the television   Excuse me  Make sure you have the record player on at night  Make sure the kids hear words  A kid coming from a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there  There's so much we can  20 No  I'm going to go like the rest of them do  twice over  Okay  Because here's the deal  The deal is that we've got this a little backwards  9 By the way  in Venezuela we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela  I know Maduro  I've confronted Maduro  7 Number two  you talk about the need to do something to Latin America  I'm the guy that came up with 740 million dollars to see to it those three countries  in fact  changed their system so people don't have a chance to leave  You're all acting like we just discovered this yesterday  Thank you very much  15 I never counted any professional setback I have as a serious setback  There's things that are important  things that aren't important  28 What'd they say  13 I'm sorry  1 There are setbacks to the setbacks  and I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose   Well  my dad had an expression  He said   Joey  it's not a question of succeeding and whether you get knocked down  it's how quickly you get up   He used to say   You never explain and never complain   Then go on to say that   The only obligation that really matters  the most important thing is family   31 So  I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything  family  and could be judged on based how you treat your family and how you went from there  It took   you know  Kierkegaard said   Faith sees best in the dark   15 Right after I got elected  my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident  and my two sons were badly injured  I'd just been elected  not sworn in  I lost my faith for awhile  I came back  Then later when my son Beau came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later  a year and a half later  losing him was like losing part of my soul  The fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose  purpose in what you do  32 That's why I hope he's proud of me today because he wanted to make sure I didn't run for president but I stayed engaged  Because when you get hit badly  whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family  like my dad  where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid   You can't live here anymore   Dad lost his job  You know  we've all been through that some form or another  It just takes   just for me  the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose  My purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy  32 There's a lot of people who went through a lot worse than I have and get up every single morning  put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had  There are real heroes out there  some real heroes  9 Tonight I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here and I expect we'll get it  I'm running for president to restore the soul of this country  We have a president  as everybody's acknowledged here  every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country  But no one man has the capacity to rip that apart  it's too strong  we're too good  Just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds  Went on to be mayors  senators  governors  congresswomen  members of the cabinet and yes  even a vice president  Mr  President  this is America and we are stronger and great because of this diversity  Mr  President  Not in spite of it  Mr  President  So Mr  President  let's get something straight  We love it  we are not leaving it  We are here to stay and we're certainly not going to leave it to you  57 Well my response is that is the Senator's had several plans so far  And anytime someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years  you should wonder why it takes 10 years  If you noticed there's no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost  3 trillion  You will lose your employer based insurance  And in fact  this is the single most important issue facing the public  And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward  you can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan  30 The plan  no matter how you cut it cost  3 trillion when it is in fact employed  Number one  10 years from now after two terms of the senator being president  after her time  Secondly  it will require middle class taxes to go up  not down  Thirdly  it will eliminate employer based insurance and fourthly  what happens in the meantime  25 My response is Obamacare is working  The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare  Go back and do  take back all the things that Trump took away  provide a public option  meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into the option if they didn't like their employer plan or if they're on Medicaid  they'd automatically be in the plan  It would be taking place immediately  it would move quickly  and it would insure the vast  vast  vast majority of Americans  30 In the mean time  what happens  Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost  My plans cost  750 billion dollars  That's what it costs  Not  30 trillion dollars  10 My plan makes a limit of copay to be  1 000  because we further support the ability to buy in to the Obamacare plan  Secondly  the idea that this is somehow a bad idea  no one has to keep their private insurance  but if they like their insurance  they should be able to keep it  Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance  it says   If the 160 million people who have it say they like their employer insurance  they should have a right to have it  If they don't  they can buy in to the Biden plan which is Obamacare with a    38 My plan will cover everyone  number one  Number two  the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices  The bio pharma is now where things are going to go  it's no longer chemicals  it's about all these breakthroughs we have with generally the whole  excuse me  immune system  And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in the HHS and says   As you develop a drug  you've got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for  We will set the price   And secondly  it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on  36  crosstalk 00 26 55  To end the  0 This is not a Republican talking point  The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare  Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat  A hundred million people with pre existing conditions  And in fact what we got is a public option  that in fact would allow anybody to buy in  No one has to keep their private insurance  they can buy into this plan  and they can buy into it with a  1 000 deductible  and never have to pay more than 8 5  of their income when they do it  And if they don't have any money  they'll get in free  So this idea is a bunch of malarkey  what we're talking about here  30 The fact of the matter is  the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible  it'll be a deductible in their paycheck  Bernie acknowledges it  Bernie acknowledges  30 trillion dollars has to all be paid  and I don't know what math you do in New York  I don't know what math you do in California  but I tell you  that's a lot of money  And there will be a deductible  The deductible will be out of your paycheck  because that's what would be required  28 Real quick  I have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices  Flat out  number one  Number two  we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for the nine billion opioids they sell out there  They are misrepresenting the American people  what need to be done  And lastly  here's the deal  The deal is  let's figure out how this works  We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like  no matter what one it is  and  33 Off of their insurance plan they don't like  no matter what one it is and buy into a Medicare option  And they can buy the Gold Plan and they're not going to have to pay  Anyway  6 Absolutely not  number one  Number two  everything landed on the President's desk but locusts  I found that Julian  excuse me  the secretary  we sat together in many meetings  I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary  14 The fact is  I don't know if you can hear  I can hear  but I don't know  7 The fact is  what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum  The women she spoke to are entitled to asylum  That is not crossing the border illegally  What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly  18 With regard to the Secretary's point  I already proposed and passed 750 million dollars for Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras to be able to change the circumstance  why people fled in the first place  In addition to that  we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border  what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing  to come to the United States and make their case  And if they don't  that they have to wait in line  30 The fact of the matter is  you should be able to  if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back  it's a crime  It's a crime  and it's not one that in fact  11 I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense  Here's the deal  The fact of the matter is that in fact when people cross the border illegally  it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum  People should have to get in line  that's the problem  And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump  We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice  26 I agree with the Senator  The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it  it has nothing to do with that section of the law  That's what he's doing  number one  9 Number two  we should in fact  and we have proposed and we tried to get past our administration  proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come  This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people  and the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture  Immigrants built this country  that's why we're so special  It took courage  it took resilience  it took absolute confidence for them to come  And we should be encouraging people  26 By the way  anybody who crosses the stage with a PhD  you should get a green card for seven years  We should keep them here  7 The President came along  and he's the guy that came up with the idea  first time ever  of dealing with the Dreamers  He put that in the law  He talked about a comprehensive plan which he lay before the congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people  He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring into this country  21 Lastly  he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it  where people were leaving in the first place  To compare him to Donald Trump I think is absolutely bizarre  12 I was Vice President  I am not the President  I keep my recommendations to him in private  Unlike you  I expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him  That's not what I do  12 What I do say to you is  he moved to fundamentally change the system  That's what he did  That's what he did  but much more has to be done  Much more has to be done  10 The fact is that's what I said about this country  We are a country of immigrants  all of us  All of us  Some here came against their will  others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives  And they did  The  inaudible 00 54 33  that's what we're talking about  That's what made us great  And the fact of the matter is  I think the President of the United States  Barack Obama went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly  28 Well  I don't   I think he is wrong  I think we should work together  He has a similar plan  I think that we should change the way we look at prisons  Right now  we're in a situation where when someone is convicted of a drug crime  they end up going to jail and to prison  They should be going to rehabilitation  They shouldn't be going to prison  18 When in prison  they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals  And when they get out of prison  they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would've had before  including Pell grants for education  including making sure that they're able to have housing  public housing  including they have all the opportunities that were available them because we want them to become better citizens  That's the essence of what my plan in detail lays out  24 I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator want to  and so I looked at it   Anyway  That's what I think my plan   I know what my plan does  and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done  It's a  14 The fact is that the bills that the President  that   Excuse me  The future President here  That the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago  and they were passed overwhelmingly  11 Since 2007  I  for example  tried to get the crack powder cocaine totally   disparity  totally eliminated  In 2007  you became mayor  and you had a police department that was   You went out  and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy  You engaged in stop and frisk  You had 75  of those stops reviewed as illegal  You found yourself in this situation with three times as many African American kids were caught in that chain and caught up  The Justice Department came after you for saying you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate  and then in fact  and nothing happened  the entire time you were mayor  37 At that point  0  crosstalk 00 03  30   0 Number one  The bill he talks about is a bill that  in my   our administration  we passed  We passed that bill that you added onto  That's the bill  in fact  you passed  And the fact of the matter is secondly  there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor  There was nothing done to deal with the police department that was trouble  Why did you announce in the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in 2007 when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine  crosstalk 00 04 30   31 We did a lot  Number one  we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38 000 people  Number one  Number two  we in fact insisted that we change the rules of police engaging  They had to have   We provided for body cameras  We made sure that there were a lot of things that were changed in the process  But 38 000 people in the federal system were released under the system  22 And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done  But here's the deal  The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long  long time ago  and now all of a sudden  I find it fascinating  Everybody's talking about how terrible I am on these issues  Barack Obama knew exactly who I was  He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties  and he chose me  and he said it was the best decision he made  26  crosstalk 00 09 30   1 When Senator Harris was the Attorney General for eight years in the state of California  there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country  In Los Angeles and in San Francisco  And she did not  I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them  18 Secondly  she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there  that in fact was abusing people's rights  And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me  that you in fact have been  the police officer did something that did not give you information that would explicate your client  She didn't do that  She never did it  And so what happened  Along came a federal judge and said   Enough  enough   and he freed  crosstalk 00 13 59  a thousand of these people  If you doubt me  Google a thousand prisoners freed  Kamala Harris  40 Because we did it  I was asked to manage an  87 billion plan  to be spent in a total of 18 months  that revived this state and many others  and it kept us out of a depression  with two tenths of 1  of waste or fraud  Secondly  I was part of the organization within our administration that pushed bailing General Motors out  saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state  Number three  Number three  I also was asked  as the Mayor of Detroit can tell you  by the president of the United States to help Detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet  I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that  We invested significantly in this city  in transportation  Anyway  the point is  we've made significant investments in this state  I expect in this city  I expect that's why the mayor endorsed me  60 I'd renegotiate it  We make up 25  of the world's economy  In order  Either China's going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are  We have to join with the 40  of the world that we had with us  and this time makes sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there  And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now  in the things that make them more competitive  That's what we have to do  Otherwise they are going to write the rules of the road  We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them  36   In check from abusing it  2 I would not rejoin the TTP as it was initially put forward  I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted  Otherwise they're going to do exactly what they're doing  Fill the vacuum and run the table  27 Yes  0 Yes  0 No  he said would I insist that labor be engaged  The answer is yes  6 Well  I love your affection for me  You spend a lot of time with me  7 Well  I tell you what  I hope you're part of it  1 That was a long time ago and here's what it was about  It would have given people making today  100 000 a year a tax break for childcare  I did not want that  I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than  100 000 and that's what it was about  As a single father  who in fact raised three children for five years by myself  I have some idea what it costs  I support making sure that every single  solitary person needing child care get an  8 000 tax credit  Now  that would put 700 000 women back to work  increase the GDP by almost eight tenths of 1   It's the right thing to do  If we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things  why can't we do it this way  46 No  What I  0 No  0 In the very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children  My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children  The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don't know what's happened  I wrote the Violence Against Women Act  Lilly Ledbetter  I was deeply involved in making sure there's the equal pay amendments  I was deeply involved in all these things  I came up with the It's On Us proposal to see to it the women were treated more decently on college campuses  You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful  I'm passionate about the concern  making sure women are treated equally  I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president  35 So did  1 That's  1 I never believed it  1 I'm getting to  0 The fact is that the Senator knows that's not my position  Everybody on this stage who's been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point  The Hyde Amendment  in the past  was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately  But once I wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would in fact have an opportunity to have health care paid for by the federal government  everyone  that that could no longer stand  I support a woman's right to choose  I support it  It's a constitutional right  I've supported it and I will continue to support it  And I will  in fact  move as president to see to that the congress legislates that that is the law as well  43 Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point  7 I did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the UN to agree to put inspectors in  From the moment Shock and Awe started  from that moment  I was opposed to the effort and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the congress and the administration  Secondly  I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq  He turned and said   Joe  get our combat troops out   In front of the entire national security team  One of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al Faw Palace and tell everyone that we're coming  all our combat troops are coming  home  35 I opposed the surge in Afghanistan  This is long overdue  We should have not  in fact  gone into Afghanistan  8   The way  1 Thank you  Mr  Vice President  I want to bring in  1 I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq  Governor  I'm sorry  Congresswoman Gabbard  your response to what Vice President Biden just said  8 Thank you  Thank you very much  And thank you Mr  Mayor for Detroit hosting this  Look  I've said it many times and I think everyone agrees with this  We're in a battle for the soul of America  This is the most consequential election any one of you no matter how old or young you are has ever  ever participate in  Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration  Hard to overcome the damage he's done  but we can overcome it  24 Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way  The America we know will no longer exist  Everybody knows who Donald Trump is  We have to let them know who we are  We choose science over fiction  We choose hope over fear  We choose unity over division  And we choose  We choose the idea that we can as Americans  when we act together  do anything  This is the United States of America  We've acted together  We have never  never  never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was  If you agree with me  go to Joe30330 and help me in this fight  Thank you very much  47 What I meant by that is  look  Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America  Ordinary middle class Americans built American  My dad used to have an expression  He said   Joe  a job is about a lot more than a paycheck  It's about your dignity  It's about respect  It's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything's going to be okay   17 Too many people who are in the middle class and poor  have had the bottom fall out under this proposal  What I'm saying is that we've got to be straight forward  We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class  they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it  They have to make sure that we are in a situation where there's continuing education and they're able to pay for it  and they have to make sure that they're able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink  28 Look  Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation  we do have enormous income inequality  The one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the  1 6 trillion in tax loopholes out there  and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy  19 I would  I'm still holding on that torch  I want to make it clear to you  Look  the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on for an education  13 The fact is that  that's why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress  That's why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title 1 schools  That's why I think we should have universal pre k  That's why I think every single person who graduates from high school  65 out of a 100 now need something beyond high school  and we should provide for them to be able to get that education  That's why there should be free community college  cutting it in half the cost of college  That's why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than  25 000 a year  Their debt is frozen  no interest payment until they get beyond that  39 We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on  So folks  there's a lot we can do  but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century  We're not doing that now  14 Look  this is very personal to me  When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident  my two boys were really very badly injured  I couldn't imagine what it'd be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately  Then when my son came home from Iraq after a year and was diagnosed with terminal cancer  he was given months to live  22 I can't fathom what would have happened if in fact they said   By the way  the last six months of your life  you're on your own  We're cutting off  You've used up your time   The fact of the matter is  that the quickest  fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare  To build on what we did  Secondly  to make sure that everyone does have any option  21 Everyone  whether they have private insurance  employer insurance  or no insurance  they in fact could buy in in the exchange to a Medicare like plan  The way to do that  you can do it quickly  Look  urgency matters  There's people right now facing what I faced  and what we faced  without any of the help I had  We must move now  I am against any democrat who opposes and tries to take down Obamacare  25 And any republican who wants to get rid of Obamacare  crosstalk 00 22 07   2 I'm sorry  beg your pardon  I didn't hear  2 Oh  no I did  0 Yeah  0 Yes  but here's the thing  1 Yes  you cannot let  as the Mayor said  you cannot let people who are sick  no matter where they come from  no matter what their status  go uncovered  You can't do that  It's just going to be taken care of period  You have to  It's the humane thing to do  13 But here's the deal  the deal is that he's right about three things  Number one  they in fact contribute to the wellbeing of the country  but they also  for example  they've increased the life span of Social Security because if they have a job  they're paying the Social Security tax  That's what they're doing  It's increasing the life span  17 They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until they're an extremist  The other thing is  folks  look we can deal with these insurance companies  We can deal with the insurance companies by number one  putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading advertising which they're doing on opioids  what they're doing paying doctors to prescribe  25 We could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare  that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are  We can do this by making sure that we're in a position that we in fact allow people  15 The first thing I would do  is unite families  I'd surge immediately  billions of dollars worth of help to the region  immediately  10 Look  I talk about foreign policy  I'm the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign  at the very end of our term  to spend 740 million dollars to deal with the problem  And that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place  It was working  We saw  as you know  a net decrease in the number of children who were coming  The crisis was abated  And along came this president  and he said he'd immediately discontinue that  28 We all talk about these things  I did it  I did it  740 million  Now look  second thing we have to do  The law now requires that reuniting those families  We would reunite those families  period  And if not  we'd put those children in a circumstance where they were safe  until we could find their parents  19 And lastly  the idea that he's in court with his justice department  saying children in cages do not need a bed  do not need a blanket  do not need a toothbrush  that is outrageous  and it should stop  13 Depending if they committed a major crime  they should be deported  President Obama  I think  did a heck of a job  To compare him to what this guy is doing is absolutely  I find  close to immoral  13 But the fact is  that look  we should not be locking people up  We should be making sure we change the circumstance  as we did  why they would leave in the first place  And those who come seeking asylum  we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them  keep them safe  until they can be heard  19 That person should not be the focus of deportation  We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things  6 It's a mischaracterization of my position across the board  I do not praise racists  That is not true  Number one  Number two  if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not I'm happy to do that  14 I was a public defender  I didn't become a prosecutor  I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when  in fact  my city was in flames because of the assassination of Dr  King  Number one  15 Now number two as the Vice President of the United States I work with a man who  in fact  we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major  major way  12 The fact is in terms of busing the busing I never   You would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council  That's fine  That's one of the things I argued for that we should be breaking down these lines  16 The bottom line here is  look  everything I've done in my career   I ran because of civil rights  I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights  Those civil rights  by the way  include not just only African Americans but the LGBT community  15 No  0 I did not oppose busing in America  What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education  That's what I opposed  I did not oppose   9 Because your city council made that decision  It was a local decision  3  crosstalk 00 07 55   0 I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran  crosstalk 00 08 09   3 I supported the ERA from the very beginning  I'm the guy that extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years  We got to the place where we got 98 of the 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it  I've also argued very strongly that we  in fact  deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box  I agree that everybody wants   Anyway  my time is up  I'm sorry  23 The first Constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was a young senator  4 I have seen what happened  Just since we were Vice President  We needed three votes to pass an  800 recovery act that kept us from going into a depression  I got three votes changed  We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt  I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes  600 billion by raising the top rate  22 As recently as after President got elected I was able to put together a coalition of  inaudible 00 13 08  that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan  11 Sometimes you can't do that  Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them  I went into 20 states  over 60 candidates  and guess what  We beat them  We won back the Senate  9 The answer is yes  Number one  when our administration  we built the largest wind farm in the world  the largest solar energy facility in the world  We drove down the price  competitive price  of both of those renewable sources  I would immediately insist that we  in fact  build 500 000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America  working with Governors  Mayors  and others  so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2030  28 I would make that we invested  400 million dollars in new science and technology to be the exporter  not only of the green economy  but economy that can create millions of jobs  But I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord  I would up the ante in that Accord  which it calls for  because we make up 15  of the problem  85  of the world makes up the rest  We have to have someone that knows how to corral the rest of the world  bring them together  and get something done like we did in our administration  35 I think you're so underestimating what Barack Obama did  He's the first man to bring together the entire world  196 nations  to commit to deal with climate change immediately  so I don't buy that  but the first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump  21 Period  0 A real 30 seconds  2 Okay  I'm the only person that's beaten the NRA nationally  I'm the guy that got the Brady Bill passed  the background checks  number one  Number two  we increase that background check  inaudible 00 39 49  during the Obama Biden administration  I'm also the only guy that got assault weapons banned  Banned  And the number of clips in a gun banned  So folks  look  and I would buyback those weapons  We already started talking about that  We tried to get it done  I think  26   As weapons  We already started talking about that  We tried to get it done  I think it can be done and it should be demanded that we do it  and that's a good expenditure of money  And lastly  we should have smart guns  No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger  It's within our right to do that  we can do that  Our enemy is the gun manufacturers  not the NRA  The gun manufacturers  20 We know NATO will fall apart if he's elected four more years  It's the single most consequential alliance in the history of the United States  6 Because once the Bush abused that power  What happened was we got elected after that  I made sure the President turned to me and said   Joe  get our combat troops out of Iraq   I was responsible for getting 150 000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them  I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan  It's long overdue  It should end  And thirdly  I believe that you're not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there  We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism  So  I'd eliminate the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AUMF  and make sure that it could only be used for what it's intent was  and that is to go after terrorists  But never do it alone  53 That's why we have to repair our alliances  We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places  That's what I would do  that's what I have done  And I know how to do it  14 You can't go to war without informed consent of the American people  3 Thank you very much  I'm ready to lead this country because I think it's important we restore the soul of this nation  This president has ripped it out  He's the only president in our history who has equated racist and white supremacist with ordinary and decent people  He's the only president who has in fact engaged and embraced dictators and thumbed their nose at our allies  I'm secondly running for president because I think we have to restore the backbone of America  The poor and hardworking middle class people  You can't do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had  33 Lastly  we've got to unite the United States of America as much as anybody says we can't  If we do  there's not a single thing the American people can't do  This is the United States of America  We can do anything if we're together  Together  So  God bless you all and may God protect our troops  21 
Andrew Yang,First  let me say America  it's great to be back on the debate stage  Thank you  I'm so excited  I want to give every American  1 000 a month  George  the entire capitalism  socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models  they did not foresee technology getting stronger  more powerful  capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye  We have record high corporate profits in this country right now  but people in New Hampshire know  what else are at record highs  Mental illness  stress  debt  substance abuse  overdoses  suicides  What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family's way of life  Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff  we should be measuring our own health and wellness  life expectancy  mental health and freedom from substance abuse  clean air  and clean water  how our kids are doing  The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our family's lives  67 George  can I say  4 Pete  fundamentally  you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump's victory  Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems  and we're making a mistake when we act like he is  10 He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years  and decades  And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease  Most Americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose  I lose  you lose  I lose for years  And you know who's been losing this entire time  We have  Our communities have  Our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet  That's why Iowa  traditional swing state  went to Trump by almost 10 points  That's why Ohio  a traditional swing state is now so red  that I'm told we're not even going to campaign there  34 So  these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens  We've automated away four million manufacturing jobs  and counting  We're closing 30  of New Hampshire stores and malls  and Amazon  the force behind that  is literally paying zero in taxes  These are the changes that Americans are seeing and feeling around us every day  and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems  we will not just defeat Donald Trump in the fall  but we'll actually be able to move our communities forward  27 There are of course limits  and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office  but the fact is  if you look around the world  the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail  have generally been developing countries  and unfortunately that's a pattern that once you establish  is very  very hard to break  What's a more American tradition  We move the country forward  We don't focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office  Most Americans do not care about what a particular individual did  so much as they care about their family's wellbeing  their community  their town  That's where Americans focus wants  They want the American president  They want the present  Of course  the American president  sorry about that  They want the president to be focused on that  and that's where our attention should be  We should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries  47 That's what we have to change  Monica  I've heard heartbreaking stories from families here in New Hampshire that have been destroyed  torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money  As President  we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in New Hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment  you have resources to be able to pursue it  24 This is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem  but money cannot be the obstacle  This is something that happened on the government's watch  The government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment  you know you're not going to be sent to jail  We have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you  23 If you have a family member who's struggling  you can refer them and know that they're not going to have criminal penalties as a result  There are so much about this that's endemic to what's happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok  this hyper corporate capitalism where if money's on one side in this country and people are on the other side  the money is winning  You can see it with the opiate epidemic  You can see it with the military industrial complex  the fossil fuel companies  This is what must change and that's where I'll lead as president  33 Elizabeth  with respect  you can't regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race specific  What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King  whose birthday we just celebrated  He said that capitalism forgets that life is social  and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of  1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color  make it so that black net work is not 10  of white net worth in this country  which is the most important number of them all  We can't regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities  The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power  and that is where we have to move as a country  56 The median African American household net work is projected to be zero by 2053  Things are not getting better for people of color  If anything  they're getting wore  because we're in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy  It's something of an economic unnatural disaster  and who suffers most in a natural disaster  People of color  people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education  27 And while I know we love to champion education here as Democrats  only 33  of Americans are going attend college  lower percentage of African Americans  There is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out African American net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and 2053  and it's not just them  it is truck drivers  it is retail clerks  it is call center workers  it is accountants  it is bookkeepers  We are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country  and it's going to hit black people the hardest  We have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem  41 George  we're in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country  and unfortunately  that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger  smarter  more capable all the time  and most of us are not  Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day  So if we want to alleviate child poverty  we need to put money directly into the hands of families  particularly single parents  40  of American children today are born to single moms  90  of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth  43 What is the market value my wife  Evelyn had  or stay at home parents around the country  Zero  Caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones  like Kyle Christensen in Iowa  Zero  Volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive  Zero  Coaches and mentors helping our kids  Zero  Most artists  sorry artists  but it's true  Zero  Increasingly local journalists  which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you can't vote on something if you actually don't have any news coverage  The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value  say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans  That we each have intrinsic value as citizens  as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world  58 It's clear why Americans can't agree on impeachment  We're getting our news from different sources  and it's making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts  Congressional approval rating  last I checked  it was something like 17 percent  and Americans don't trust the media networks to tell them the truth  The media networks didn't do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place  If you turn on cable network news today  you would think he's our president because of some combination of Russia  racism  Facebook  Hillary Clinton  and e mails all mixed together  32 But Americans around the country  no different  We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio  Michigan  Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  Missouri  I just left Iowa  We blasted 40 000 manufacturing jobs there  The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems  the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what's going on in our communities and solve those problems  What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment  which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be  and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place  We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country  a new way forward to help beat him in 2020  because make no mistake  he'll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat  55 Yes  Where I live folks aren't measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking  they're measuring the economy by how they're doing  When you're doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table  and you find that  even if your wages have gone up  is not nearly going as fast as the cost of health  and how's  This economy is not working for most of us  for the middle class  and  I know you're only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics  but we've got to talk about poverty in this country  29 There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full time at the minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment  In most places  not even a one bedroom apartment  The biggest problem in our economy is simple   people are not getting paid enough  That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force  It's the result of bad policy  and we've got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers  30 GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today  Also at record highs  depression  financial insecurity  student loan debt  even suicides and drug overdoses  It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years  because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history  The fact is  this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people's lived experience on the ground  If you're a recent college graduate  you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesn't require a college degree  That doesn't show up in the headline unemployment rate  nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by  44 Well first we should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change  We're already doing it  We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose  And we know that town is not alone  That's playing out in coastal areas around the country  The question is  do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say   We need to protect our people from climate change   Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground  Because that's what we need to do and that's literal and figurative  Here in California  it's forest fires and forest management  And nuclear power  I agree with the research  We need to have everything on the table in a crisis situation  which this is  43 Other countries have had success with nuclear power and the next generation Thoriam reactors have a wealth of potential  Thoriam is not radioactive the way uranium is  It doesn't last as long and you can't make a weapon out of it  Whereas if we're going to innovate our way out of this  as Elizabeth is saying  then we have to have nuclear on the table  19 It's both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight  4  Honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight  I miss Kamala  I miss Cory  though I think Cory will be back  I grew up the son of immigrants and I had many racial epithets used against me as a kid  but black and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words  They have numbers  The average net worth of a black household is only 10  that of a white household  For Latinos  it's 12   If you're a black woman  you're 320  more likely to die from complications in childbirth  These are the numbers that define race in our country  And the question is  why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage  Fewer than 5  of Americans donate to political campaigns  You know what you need to donate to political campaigns  Disposable income  54 The way we fix it  The way we fix this is we take Martin Luther King's message of a guaranteed minimum income  a freedom dividend of  1 000 a month for all Americans  I guarantee  if we had a freedom dividend of  1 000 a month  I would not be the only candidate of color on this stage tonight  15 I have family in Hong Kong  I spent four months there and seeing what's happening on the streets  It's shocking  They banned face masks in Hong Kong  Why  Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later  This is the rivalry that we have to win where China's concerned  They're in the process of leapfrogging us in AI because they have more data than we do and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars  34 I have sat with our leading technologists and they say they cannot match the Chinese resources  China just produced its first major smartphone that does not have Google apps and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world  What we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards and then you can bring the Chinese to the table in a very real way because this is their top priority and this is where we need to out compete them and win  25 Of course  I would  I'm the son of immigrants myself and I know that DREAMers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification  I just want to return to this conversation because I think it's core  Our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that  Money and men are tied together  That's where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation  The fact is  strong societies would elect more female leaders  Strong men treat women well for the same reasons  I'm on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while  we kind of become morons  52 So  it's related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti woman marketplace  and that includes the marketplace for politicians  If we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter  instead of 5  contributing  you'd see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60  and you'd have many  many more women who would run for office because they don't have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave  27 I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by DREAMers in the first hundred days  I would make it a top priority  I'm the son of immigrants myself  The fact is almost half of fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants  Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic  And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with  If you go to the factory in Michigan  it's not wall to wall immigrants  It's wall to wall robot arms and machines  We have to send the opposite message of this administration and  as your a president  I think I could send a very clear message  where if you're considering immigrating to this country and I'm the president  you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States  That's the opposite of the current administration and that's the message I would love to send to the world  44 I would love it  I have a son with special needs and to me special needs is the new normal in this country  How many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism  If you look around  most hands went up  The fact is right now we have to do more for Kyle  Special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases  And here's the challenge  We go to employers and say  Hey  this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace  which may be correct  but that's not the point  We have to stop confusing economic value in human value  We have to be able to say to our kids and Kyle that you have intrinsic value because you are an American and you are a human being  40 We're going to put a freedom dividend of  1 000 a month in everyone's hands  which is going to help families around the country adapt and then we're going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority  not a local one  So not not robbing Peter to pay Paul  18 Wow  2 I know what you're thinking  America  how am I still on this stage with them   crosstalk 00 01 31  9 Our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser focused on solving the real problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place  I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit  Baltimore  New Orleans and other cities  serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama  and I saw firsthand what many of you already know  our country is falling apart  Our senior citizens are working until the day they die  Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs  We're seeing record high levels of depression  suicides  overdoses  Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger  Our way of life is changing faster than ever  And the simple fact is this  our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail  Washington DC today is the richest city in our country  What do they produce  Bad decisions  We need to get the money out of DC and into your hands  the hands of the American people  Join us in Yang2020 com and help us rewrite the rules of the 20th century economy to work for us  71 Well first  I just want to stick up for Tom  We have a broken campaign finance system  but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change  and you can't knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way  my opinion  11 Yeah  no problem  As Commander in Chief  I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century  And what are those threats  Climate change  artificial intelligence  loose nuclear material  military drones  and non state actors  And if you look up  we're in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now  Because they have more access to more data than we do  and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not  We are 24 years behind on technology  and I can say that with authority  because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995  Think about that timing  I guess they thought they'd invented everything  The next Commander in Chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow  and that's what I'll bring to the table as commander in chief  54 There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms  the United States of America and Papua New Guinea  that is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible  I would pass paid family leave is one of the first things we do  I have two kids myself who are four and seven  one of whom is autistic and has special needs and it's breaking families backs  21 We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning because by the time they're showing up to Pre K and kindergarten  in many cases  they're already years behind  Studies have shown that two thirds of our kids' educational outcomes are determined by what's happening to them at home  This is stress levels  number of words  read to them as children type of neighborhood  whether a parent has time to spend with them  26 So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one   1 000 a month for every American adult  which would put in many cases   2 000 a month into families pockets so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child  We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce  Many parents see that trade off and say if they leave the home and work  they're going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway  In many cases  it'd be better if the parents stays home with the child  29 Well  first I'd say   I'm sorry I beat your guy   3 Well  not sorry  And second  I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression  The American people would back me on this  We know that they've found an underbelly and they've been clawing at it and it's made so that we can't even trust our own democracy  The third thing I would say is that we're going to live up to our international commitments  We're going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances including NATO  And it was James Mattis  that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy  the less you have to spend on ammunition  45 That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus  not just against Russia  but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities and what's going on in Hong Kong  I want to propose a new world data organization  like a WTO for data because right now unfortunately we're living in a world where data is the new oil and we don't have our arms around it  These are the ways that we'll actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order  34 Well  first we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it  I talked to an anti  hate activist named Christian Picciolini  who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10 year period  He said he was a lonely 14 year old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade  Now  he's out and he's helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society  But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt  broken 14 year old boy  he would have gone with them  39 He said   If it had been a coach I would have gone with him  If it had been a mentor teacher  I would have gone with them  but instead it was a hate group   What we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular  who right now are falling through the cracks  And when you look at gun violence in this country  96 plus percent of the shooters we're talking about are young boys and young men  We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy  strong  young men who do not hate  but instead feel like they have paths forward in today's economy  34 I'm here with my wife Evelyn  tonight  We have two young boys  Christopher and Damian  How many of you all are parents like us here in the room  If you're a parent  you've had this thought  Maybe you've been afraid to express it  and it is this  our kids are not all right  They're not all right because we're leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents  We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history  the fourth industrial revolution  and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side  We talk as if Donald Trump is a cause of all of our problems  He is not  He is a symptom and we need to cure the disease  37 Now  my first move was not to run for president of the United States because I am not insane  My first move was to go to D C   talk to our leaders and say   Technology is ripping us apart  Immigrants are being scapegoated  our kids are being left behind and the American dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes   The people in Washington D C  had nothing for this  They don't want to touch it  They don't want to talk about an issue they don't think they have a solution for  I'm not running for president because I fantasized about being president  34 I'm running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight  I'm a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future that we're leaving for our kids  It is not something I'm willing to accept  We need to create a new way forward for our people  If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy  go to Yang2020 com  and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them and believe it   Your country loves you  your country values you and you will be all right   29 I support impeachment  but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will one be successful or two  erase the problems that got him elected in 2016  We're standing in the great state of Ohio  the ultimate purple state  the ultimate bellwether state  Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points  Because we got rid of 300 000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and we're not stopping there  How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio  Raise your hands  It's not just you  Amazon alone as closing 30  of America's stores in malls soaking up  20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes  These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected  the fourth industrial revolution and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office  The fact is  Donald Trump  when we're talking about him  we are losing  We need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump  54 I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee  but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice  What are the jobs  Who manages you  What if you don't like your job  What if you're not good at your job  The fact is  most Americans do not want to work for the federal government and saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century  to me  is not a vision that most Americans would embrace  23 Also  Senator Sanders' description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife  who's at home with our two boys  one of whom is autistic  We have a freedom dividend of  1 000 a month  It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities  It helps all Americans transition  because the fact is  and you know this in Ohio  if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources  you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants  When we put the money into our hands  we can build a trickle up economy from our people  our families  and our communities up  It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do  This is the sort of positive vision in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution that we have to embrace as a party  46 Senator Warren  I just need to address this  Senator Warren  I've been talking  0  to Americans around the country about automation  and they're smart  They see what's happening around them  Their Main Street stores are closing  They see a self serve kiosk in every McDonald's  every grocery store  every CVS  Driving a truck as the most common job in 29 States  including this one  Three and a half million truck drivers in this country  and my friends in California are piloting self driving trucks  What does that going to mean for the three and a half million truckers or the seven million Americans who work in truck stops  motels  and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal  Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day  34 I have the data  0 Senator Warren is 100  right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in history  and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle  The problem is that it's been tried in Germany  France  Denmark  Sweden  and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected  If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries  what can we learn from  We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes  Instead  we should look at what Germany  France  Denmark  and Sweden still have  which is a value added tax  If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale  every Google search  every robot truck mile  every Facebook ad  we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands  because we know best how to use it  49 Of course  We have to look at the chain of events  How did we get here  The fact is  we were falling apart at home  so we voted in Donald Trump  and he's now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy  We have to let Russia know   Look  we get it  We've tampered with other elections  You've tampered with our elections  And now it has to stop  And if it does not stop  we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people   I believe most Americans would support me on this  27 But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity  climate change  loose nuclear material  military drones and non state actors  These are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology  We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology  We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress  the nature of the questioning  As Commander in Chief  I will help pull us forward  27   and that's going to be a huge responsibility of the next president  1 That's exactly right  and we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amuck  There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio  and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate  They ended up levying a  600 million fine against Purdue Pharma  which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made  30 billion  They got a 2  fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans an hour  So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people  then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well  Even though this is not a money problem  we all know this is a human problem  41 Part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell  they will be referred to treatment and counseling  I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again  because the fact is after you save someone who's ODing  you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week  So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use  We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing  this was a systemic government failing  and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives  34 As usual  Senator Warren is 100  right in diagnosing the problem  There are absolutely excesses in technology  and in some cases  having them divest parts of their business is the right move  but we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all of the problems  It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app  that would be like  inaudible 00 29 09   There's a reason why no one is using Bing today  Sorry  Microsoft  it's true  So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive main street businesses around the country  32 And as the parent of two young children  I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children  Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use  Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier  What we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems  Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work  We need new solutions and a new toolkit  32  crosstalk 02 17 32  That's the way we can fight back   crosstalk 02 17 34  The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property  Right now our data is worth more than oil  How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail  It got lost  It went to Facebook  Amazon  Google  If we say this is our property and we share in the gains that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies  20 First I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home  If you don't feel like you got your question answered tonight  it's understandable  there are 12 of us  I'm going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours Friday  My website  yang2020 com and if you ask your question tonight  there's a better chance I'll get to it  My surprising friendship  it's been so much fun running for president because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise  The friendship that sticks out for me guy named Fred  who's an avid Trump supporter  a trucker  He let me ride in his truck for hours  He spent some time in jail  I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs  And I'm happy to say that after our ride together  he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign  which was a thrill for me  And we've remained in touch ever since  48 The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party  The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail  call centers  transportation  as well as to white collar workers like attorneys  pharmacists  and radiologists  It does not care about our party  Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016 and what did he say  He said  we're going to build a wall  We're going to turn the clock back  We're going to bring the old jobs back  America  we have to do the opposite of all of these things  We have to turn the clock forward  We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible  We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value  It is not left  it is not right  it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020  52 We're in the midst of the greatest economic transformation  3 In America today  everything revolves around the almighty dollar  Our schools  our hospitals  our media  even our government  It's why we don't trust our institutions anymore  We have to get our country working for us again  instead of the other way around  We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy  rather than inputs into a giant machine  23 When you donate money to a presidential campaign  what happens  The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants  and you hope it works out  It's time to trust ourselves more than our politicians  That's why I'm going to do something unprecedented tonight  My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of  1 000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families  Someone watching this at home right now  If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician  go to yang2020 com and tell us how  1 000 a month will help you do just that  This is how we will get our country working for us again  the American people  42 Come on  guys  Come on  0 Look  everyone  we know we're on the same team here  We know we're on the same team  We all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president  and I believe we're talking about this the wrong way  As someone who has a business  I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people  it makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full time employees  You instead pretend they're contractors  It's harder to change jobs  It's certainly harder to start a business  The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people  36 Now  I am Asian  so I know a lot of doctors  and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork  avoiding being sued  and navigating the insurance bureaucracy  We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity people are focused on our health in the healthcare system  and the Cleveland Clinic where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe  shocker  they prescribe fewer procedures  and patient health stays the same or improves  That is the pitch to the American people  29 My father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor and now his son is running for president  That is the immigration story that we have to be able to share it with the American people  If you look at our history  almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities  We have to say to the American people  immigrants are positive for economic and social dynamism  And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama  Biden administration  34 I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways  He says   Build a wall   I'm going to say to immigrants   Come to America  because if you come here  your son or daughter can run for president  The water's great and this is where you want to build a company  build a family  and build a life   This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations  If we lose that  we lose something integral to our continued success and that is where I would lead as president  28 I would not repeal the tariffs on day one  but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal  Because right now the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China  14 A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated US intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head  And he said   One  how can my workers compete against that  And two  think about all the lost revenue to American companies   So the imbalances are real  but we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that president Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides  So no to repealing the tariffs immediately  but yes  to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers  39 I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars  We've been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years  which is not what the American people want  We have to start owning what we can and can't do  We're not very good at rebuilding countries  And if you want proof  all you have to do is look within our own country at Puerto Rico  We've spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits  lost thousands of lives  And thank you  Pete  for your service  25 And the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades  I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment  What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view  and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way  And that's what I would do as president  24 To follow up on what Elizabeth said  why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies  Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA  The answer is this  we all know  everyone on this stage knows  that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests  Now everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests  but we have to face facts  Money finds a way  Money will find its way back in  24 What is the answer  The answer is to wash the money out with people powered money  My proposal is that we give every American 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like  This would washout the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one  That is the only way we will win  As someone running for president I'll tell you  there's the people on one side and the money on the other  The only way for us to win is if we bring them together  27 Let me be clear  I am pro good school  I've got a kid   One of my little boys just started public school last week  and I was not there because I was running for president  We need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold  We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests  which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human word  28 But here's the big one  the data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students' outcomes are determined outside of the school  We're talking about time spent at home with the parents  words read to them when they're young  stress levels in the house  income  type of neighborhood  We're putting money into schools  and educators know this  We're saying   You're 100  responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30    They all know this  The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn  and our teachers a chance to teach  36 I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months  and I left to start a business  I'm going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship  If you want to start something  tell everyone you know you're going to do it  Then you don't have a choice  You put your heart and soul into it  Even though I did that  my company flopped  had its mini rise and maximum fall  lost investors  hundreds of thousands of dollars  Still owed 100 000 in school debt  My parents still told people I was a lawyer  I guess it was a little easier  27 So  I remember lying on my floor  looking up  wondering how did it come to this  Eventually  I picked myself back up  I kept working in small growth companies for another ten years and eventually had some success  Then after I did have some success  I still remembered how hard it was  how isolating it was  how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you  So  I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country  including Sean Wen  who's here in the audience tonight who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio  Sean  I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me  The goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations  45 If you heard anything about me and my campaign  you've heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every American  1 000 a month  I know this may sound like a gimmick but this is a deeply American idea  From Thomas Payne to Martin Luther King to today  Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it  Why do we need to do it  We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next  If you don't believe me  just ask an auto worker here in Detroit  How do we pay for it  Raise your hand in the crowd if you've seen stores closing where you live  It is not just you  Amazon is closing 30  of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it  We need to do the opposite of much of what we're doing right now  And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math  So let me share the math  On  1 000 a month for every adult would be  461 million every month right here in Detroit alone  The automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today  It is why Donald Trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people  72 I just want to share a story  When I told my wife I was running for president  you know the first question she asked me  What are we going to do about our healthcare  That's a true story and it's not just us  Democrats are talking about healthcare in the wrong way  As someone who's run a business  I can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire  It makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full time employees  It makes it harder to switch jobs  as Senator Harris just said  and it's certainly a lot harder to start a business  If we say   Look  we're going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families  then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom   That's the argument we should be making to the American people  36 I'm the son of immigrants myself  My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 US patents for GE and IBM  I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States  That's the immigration story we need to be telling  We can't always be focusing on some of the distress stories  18 And if you go to a factory here in Michigan  you will not find wall to wall immigrants  You will find wall to wall robots and machines  Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy  10 I speak for just about everyone watching when I say I would trust anyone on this stage much more than I would trust our current president on matters of criminal justice  We cannot tear each other down  We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020  13 I want to share a story that a prison guard  a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me  He said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they're behind bars  Right now  we think we're saving money  We just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways  We should put money directly into people's hands  certainly  when they come out of prison  but before they go into prison  20 Well  I'm building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters  independents  libertarians  and conservatives  as well as Democrats and progressives  I believe I'm the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump  And as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania  the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind  What we have to do is we have to say look  there is record high GDP and stock market prices  You know what else are at record highs  Suicides  drug overdoses  depression  anxiety  It's gotten so bad that American life expectancy has declined for the last three years  31 And I like to talk about my wife who's at home with our two boys right now  one of whom is autistic  What does her work count at in today's economy  Zero  and we know that's the opposite of the truth  We know that her work is among the most challenging and vital  The way we win this election is we redefine economic progress to include all the things that matter to the people in Michigan and all of us  like our own health  our well being  our mental health  our clean air and clean water  how our kids are doing  If we change the measurements for the 21st century economy to revolve around our own well being  then we will win this election  37 I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned  particularly in startups and entrepreneurship  We have to do more at every step  And  if you are a woman entrepreneur  the obstacles start not just at home  But then when you seek a mentor or an investor often they don't look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one  In order to give women a leg up  what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation  including the ones who are in exploitative and abusive jobs and relationships around the country  I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner  who might have a business idea  but right now is stuck where she is  What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses  And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of  1 000 a month into their hands  It would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society  It will not change unless we change it  And I say that's just what we do  60 I would move to deescalate tensions in Iran  because they're responding to the fact that we've pulled out of this agreement  And it wasn't just us and Iran  there were many other world powers that were part of that multilateral agreement  We'd have to try and reenter that agreement  renegotiate the timelines  because the timelines now don't make as much sense  But I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars  Right now our strength abroad reflects our strength at home  What's happened  really  We've fallen apart at home so we elected Donald Trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies  What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problem right here at home  We've spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that had unclear benefits  We've been in a constant state of war for 18 years  This is not what the American people want  I would bring the troops home  I would deescalate tensions with Iran  And I would start investing our resources in our own communities  58 You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate  It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on this stage in national polling  It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie  Instead of talking about automation and our future  including the fact that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs  hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan  We're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality TV show  It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our President  32 We need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today  like the fact that the most common job jobs in America may not exist in a decade  Or  that most Americans cannot pay their bills  My flagship proposal  the Freedom Dividend  would put  1 000 a month into the hands of every American adult  be a game changer for millions of American families  If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear  enter your zip code at yang2020 com  and see what  1 000 a month would mean to your community  I have done the math  It's not left  It's not right  It's forward  And that is how we're going to beat Donald Trump in 2020  40 That's right  2 I'm sorry  2 Oh  so it's difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon  trillion dollar tech companies paying literally zero in taxes  while they're closing 30  of our stores  9 Now  we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all these innovations in other parts of the economy  and if we had a value added tax at even half the European level  it would generate over  800 billion in new revenue  which combined with the money in our hands  it would be the trickle up economy from our people  families and communities up  We would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods  creating millions of jobs  making our families stronger and healthier  23 We'd save money on things like incarceration  homelessness services  emergency room healthcare  And just the value gains from having a stronger  healthier  mentally healthier population would increase GDP by  700 billion  This is the move that we have to make  particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American jobs  It's why Donald Trump is our President today  that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan  Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  And we're about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs  call center jobs  fast food jobs  truck driving jobs  and on and on through the account  32 Well  the value added tax would end up   you'd still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94  of Americans  You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up  12 000 a year per individual  So for the average family with two or three adults  it'd be  24 000 to  36 000 a year  17 Well  I just want to agree that I think Russia is our greatest geopolitical threat  because they've been hacking our democracy successfully  and they've been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years  So we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats  14 Now  China  they do pirate our intellectual property  It's a massive problem  But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides  I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that's now disappeared and gone forever  And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or people in China  It's been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void  24 So we need to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship  but the tariffs and the trade war are the way to go  7 I would pass a  1 000 freedom dividend for every American adult starting at age 18  which would speed us up on climate change  because if you get the boot off of people's throats  they'll focus on climate change much more clearly  10 China  we need to cooperate with them on climate change  AI  and other issues  North Korea  4 First  I want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight  I am proof that our democracy still works  Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee  and that is   Who can beat Donald Trump in 2020   That is the right question and the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected  and will have a vision of a trickle up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters  conservatives  independents  and libertarians  as well as democrats and progressives  I am that candidate  I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump  It is not left  it is not right  it is forward  and that is where I'll talk the country in 2020  37 
Kamala Harris,Well first of all  we have a criminal living in the White House  and there is no question that in 2020  the biggest issue before us  until we get to that tender moment is justice is on the ballot  And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland  by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop  That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President  from what we heard today  the Vice President  the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff  And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward  but it also points to another issue  40 And back to the question that you asked earlier  which is what does this mean for the American people  Because what it means when I watch this  is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America  The powerful people  who with their arrogance think they can get away with this  and then everybody else  Because here's the thing  For those working people who are working two and three jobs  if they don't pay that credit card by the end of the month  they get a penalty  For the people who don't pay their rent  they get evicted  For the people who shoplift  they go to jail  We need the same set of rules for everybody  and part of the reason I'm running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people  And not just for some  43 Oh  sure  I think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the democratic nominee for President of the United States  who during the Obama administration spent four years  full time on Fox news criticizing President Obama  20 Who had spent full time criticizing people on this stage  as affiliated with the democratic party  when Donald Trump was elected  not even sworn in  buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower  fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal  and then spends full time during the course of this campaign  again  criticizing the democratic party  What we need on the stage on the November is someone who has the ability to win  and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump  and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition  and bring the party and the nation together  I believe I am that candidate  51 I believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people  I spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom  speaking five words  Kamala Harris for the people  And it was about all the people  regardless of their race  regardless of their gender  regardless of where they live geographically  regardless of the party with which they're registered to vote  or the language their grandmother speaks  We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country  and to win the election  and I believe again  I am that candidate  36 Thank you  1 Sure  Everybody please visit my website  kamalaharris org for the details on everything I talk about  Six months  so part of how I believe we're going to win this election is it is going to be because we are focused on the future  We are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow  22 So on paid family leave  it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s  People are having children in their 30s often in their 40s  which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents  Which requires a lot of work from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare  to all of the activities that are required  much less the healthcare needs that are required  27 And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work  And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family  or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on  So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today  27 The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America  We pass the Equal Pay Act in 1963 but fast forward to the year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar  Black women  61 cents  Native American women  58 cents Latinos  53 cents  17 So  but so my policy is about  there's a whole collection of work that I'm doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and therefore the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed  15 With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate  Donald Trump got punked  He has conducted foreign policy since day one  born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander in chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and Homeland  And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military  but that when we walk in any room around the globe  we are respected because we keep to our word  we are consistent  we speak truth  and we are loyal  54 What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times  including most recently  the Kurds  points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment  21 Not at this point  There are no concessions to be made  He has traded a photo op for nothing  He has abandoned by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year and a half  so those operations which should be  and those exercises which should be active because they are in our best national security  22 The relationship that we have with Japan  He has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea's nuclear program  12 Well  I don't know  that was a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published  But listen  I think that it really speaks to a larger issue and I'll speak to the larger issue  I believe that the Mayor has made apologies for that  The larger issue is that for too long  I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies  They show up when it's close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote  but just haven't been there before  46 I mean  there are plenty of people who applauded black women and for the success of the 2018 election  applauded black women for the election of a Senator from Alabama  But at some point folks get tired of just saying   Oh  thank me for showing up   and say   Well  show up for me   Because when black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America  When the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death  When black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar  the question has to be where you been and what are you going to do  And do you understand who the people are  55 And I'm running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks  and we've got to recreate the Obama coalition to win  And that means about women  that's people of color  that's our LGBTQ community  that's working people  that's our labor unions  But that is how we are going to win this election  And I intend to win  23 Look  there is a lot at stake in this election  And I've said it many times I think justice is on the ballot in 2020  And it's about economic justice  it's about justice for children  it's about justice for our teachers  I could go on down the list  The issue really is not what is the fight  the issue has to be how are we going to win  And to win we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition  I keep referring to that because that's the last time we won  29 And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities  knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together and everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and therefore ability to bring folks together around our commonalities of which I believe there are many  21 That's not true  0 We're in a fight  This is a fight for our rule of law  for our democracy and for our system of justice  and it's a fight we need to win  To fight this fight  I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with Donald Trump  I have taken on Jeff  Session 00 23 44   I have taken on Bill Barr  I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh  I know I have the ability to do that  We also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that  I've done that work  I believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race  their gender  their party affiliation  where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks  54 My entire career has been spent having one client and one client only  the people  I have never represented a corporation  I have never represented a special interest  In this election  justice and the various injustices people are facing regardless of where they live or their race or gender  are very much on the ballot  from economic justice to reproductive justice  to health care justice  to educational justice  I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices  we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America  That's the America I believe in  That's the America I see  That is why I'm running for president  44 Well  it's just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight  I mean  it's shocking  but he told us who he was  Maya Angelou who told us years ago  listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time  During that election  Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it  And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people  He's been selling out working people  He's been selling out our values  he's been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine  he's been selling out our democracy  Our framers imagined this moment  a moment where we would have a corrupt president  And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances  This is one of those moments  And so Congress must ask but the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor  I know a confession when I see it  54 And and he did it in plain sight  He has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up  putting it in that special server and there has been a clear consciousness of guilt  This will not take very long  Donald Trump needs to be held accountable  He is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had  18 This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on women's access to reproductive healthcare  which it's under full on attack in America today  and it's outrageous  There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare  And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die  poor women  women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies  Women are the majority of the population in this country  People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the  48   country  people need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives  2 Let's talk about that  That is a significant healthcare issue in America today  6 Right  0 Well  here's how I think about it  When I was growing up  my mother raised my sister and me  We would often come home from school before she came home from work  She'd come home  she'd cook dinner  and at some point we'd go to bed and she'd sit up at the kitchen table  trying to figure out how to make it all work  When I think about where we are right now in 2020  I do believe justices on the ballot  It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment  It's on the ballot in terms of economic justice  health justice  and so many other issues  When I think about this issue  I'm thinking about that dad  who tonight is going to be sitting his kitchen table after everyone's gone to sleep  and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee  trying to figure out how he's going to make it work  He's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month  he's going to have to start driving an Uber  54 What does that mean  That means that with those two jobs  he's going to miss his kids' soccer games  That's the reality for Americans today  which is why yes  when I get elected and and pass this bill  which will give the American family who makes less than  100 000 a year a tax credit of up to  6 000 a year that they can take home at up to  500 a month  that's going to make a real difference in that man's life  Don't tell him that's not a big deal  26  NAME  1 That's a great question  Anderson  because the Commander in Chief of the United States of America has  as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities  to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland  I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee  I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security  and hotspots around the world  22 What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out  And in this case  he sold out the Kurds  who  yes  fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS  And let's be clear  what Donald Trump has done because of that phone call with Erdogan is basically giving 10 000 ISIS fighters a get out of jail free card  And you know who the winner is in this  There are four  Russia  Iran  Assad  and ISIS  This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making  and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making  And that's why dude got to go  and when I am Commander in Chief  we will stop this madness  43 Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today  During the course of this debate  eight people will die from gun violence  The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence  more than the top other six reasons totaled  This is a serious matter  I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you  I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you  I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you  40 I'm done  and we need action  and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage  When I'm elected  I'll give them 100 days to pull their act together  put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don't  I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country  because it is time to act  25 I am  and I will tell you as a former prosecutor  I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability  because they are nothing more than some high level dope dealers  They have been engaged   and I've seen it happen before  I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was Attorney General of California and led the second largest Department of Justice  I've seen what they do  The eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies  last year profited  72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis  which is a public health epidemic  44 And they knew what they were doing  They were marketing false advertising  They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio  without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks  And yes  they should be held accountable  This is a matter of justice  And so as as President of the United States  I would ensure that the United States Department Of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal  let's end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and let's go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they've been doing to destroy our country in States like Ohio  38 Marc  Marc  0 No I don't agree with that at all  As serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee  working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure  knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again  that's a ridiculous argument he's making  19 But I do want to also say this  What we're talking about is a grave injustice  When rules apply to some but not equally to all  In particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful  13 Senator Warren I just want to say that I was surprised to here that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies  When I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account that you did not agree  I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses  to threaten witnesses  to obstruct justice  He and his account should be taken down  38 We saw in El Paso that that shooter  in his manifesto  was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform  This is a matter of corporate responsibility  Twitter should be held accountable and shutdown that site  It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability  15 Then join me if you don't  0 Join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down  3 No  1 Wow  0 You can't say you're for corporate  1   responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone  3 It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people  This is a matter  you are saying  of holding big tech accountable  11 Holding big tech accountable because they have an out sized influence on people's perceptions about issues  They actually influence behaviors  We all have to agree this is their power  it is immense  14  crosstalk 02 14 55  I'm not finished   crosstalk 02 14 57  I'm not finished  What I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook  12 So you will join me in saying  0   Twitter should shutdown that account  2 There's a bigger issue here  1 My plan is as follows  for any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution  and in particular Roe v  Wade  our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v  Wade and the Constitution  If it is not that law will not go into affect  That's called pre clearance  23 Because the reality is that while we still have  as I said earlier  these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch  mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies  then there needs to be accountability and consequence  17 But I'll go further  You may have seen I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Asked him  as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court  could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body  The answer was   Uh  uh  no   The reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America  Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species  Our bodies were created to do that  It does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body  It is her body  it is her right  it is her decision  42 Thank you  Probably Paul Ryan  Actually  I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States  He and I agree on almost nothing  but we agreed on that  And after we joined forces  he said to me   Kamila  you know  Appalachia loves this  And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us  And I guess that's why I'm running  I do believe that to beat Donald Trump  but also to heal our country  We need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us  And I'll tell you  my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer  52 And so she arrived in California  she was supposed to have an arranged marriage  but she got involved in the civil rights movement  She met my father and that produced my sister and me  They got married  But when I was five  that marriage ended  But my mother convinced us that we could do anything  And so I became the first woman attorney  general California  The second black woman elected to the United States Senate  And I will tell you  that's part of why I'm running  because Donald Trump  if he had his way  my story would not be possible  And I am running to make sure that that dream  the American dream  American values  American ideals will always hold true  And so that's what is at stake in this election and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it  53 We fight for our country  That's the nature of who we are  4 Thank you  It's great to be back at TSU  I plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night  First  I have a few words for Donald Trump  who we all know is watching  President Trump  you spent the last two and a half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us  and that is why we've gotten nothing done  You have used hate  intimidation  fear  and over 12 000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises  The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says the sitting president cannot be charged with a crime  Here's what you don't get  What you don't get is that the American people are so much better than this  We know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us  regardless of our race  where we live  or the party with which we're registered to vote  I plan on focusing on our common issues  our common hopes and desires  and in that way  unifying our country  winning this election  and turning the page for America  Now President Trump  you can go back to watching Fox News  87 I want to give credit first to Barrack Obama for really bringing us this far  We would not be here if he hadn't the courage  the talent  or the will to see us this far  I want to give credit to Bernie  Take credit  Bernie  You brought us this far in Medicare for All  I support Medicare for All  I always have  but I wanted to make the plan better  which I did  Which is about offering people choice  not taking that from them  So under my Medicare for All plan people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan  because that's what people want  and I agree we shouldn't take choice from people  But here's the thing  everybody on this stage I do believe is well intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage  But at least five people have talked  some repeatedly on this subject  and not once have we talked about Donald Trump  56 So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act  We all fought against it  and then the late great John McCain  at that moment at about 2 00 in the morning  killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country  Fast forward to today  and what is happening  Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act  Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have preexisting conditions coverage  Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans  and frankly I think this discussion have given the American public a headache  What they want to know is that they're going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it  But let's focus on the end goal  If we don't get Donald Trump out of office he's going to get rid of all of it  68 I'm glad you asked me this question  and there have been many distortions of my record  Let me be very clear  I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons  one  I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe  and second  I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias  and I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had  But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system  I would try to do it from the inside  So I took on the position that allowed me  without asking permission  to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs  I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full time  60 I created one of the first in the nation training for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system  Was I able to get enough done  Absolutely not  but my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration  about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system  I plan on shutting down for profit prisons on day one  It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement  including prosecutors  accountable  and finally  my plan is about making sure that in America's criminal justice system we de incarcerate woman and children  that we end solitary confinement  and that we work on keeping families intact  And as President of the United States  knowing the system from the inside  I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete  55 That's right  0 I mean I would just say   Hey Joe instead of saying that we can't let say yes we can   7 Yes we can  Because I'll tell you something  The way that I think about this is I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you  I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you  I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you  And the idea that we would wait for this congress  which has just done nothing to act is just  It is overlooking the fact that every day in America our babies are going to school to have drills  Elementary  middle and high school students where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school  54 I was talking about this at one of my town halls and this child was eight years old probably  came up to me  It was like it was a secret between the two of us and he tugged on my jacket and he said   I had to have one of those drills   It is traumatizing our children  El Paso and Beto God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy  People asked me in El Paso  they said  because I have a long standing record on this issue  They said   Well  do you think Trump is responsible for what happened   And I said   Well  look  I mean  obviously he didn't pull the trigger  but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition   43 Could I tell you what you could do to respond today  2 Can I respond  5 Well  first of all  I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now  which is that we've got a guy in The White House who has been erratic on trade policy  He conducts trade policy by tweet  frankly born out of his fragile ego  It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soy beans rotting in bins looking at bankruptcy  When we look at this issue  my trade policy under a Harris administration is always going to be about saying   We need to export American products  not American jobs   And to do that we have to have a meaningful trade policy  I am not a protectionist Democrat  Look  we need to sell our stuff  and that means we need to sell it to people overseas  That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen  44 You asked earlier about China  it's a complicated relationship  We have to hold China accountable  They steal our products  including our intellectual property  They dump substandard products into our economy  They need to be held accountable  13 We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents  We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea  I am on  and I think the only person on this stage  the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland security committee  We need a partner on the issue of North Korea  But the bottom line is this  Donald Trump in office on trade policy  you know  he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz  you know  when you pull back the curtain it's a really small dude  33 When I think about this issue  it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one and a half and three years old  When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing  when they turn 20  I am really scared  And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two and a half years  and I look at our counterparts  the Republicans in the United States Senate  they must be looking at their children  And then when they look at the mirror  I don't know what they see  but it's a lack of courage  30 And this is an issue that  yes  it represents an existential threat  It is also something we can do something about  This is a problem that was created by human behaviors  and we can change our behaviors in a way that  15   and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet  I've seen it happen in California  I took on as the Attorney General of California  I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States  Second only to the United States Department of Justice  I took on the big oil companies  We saw progress  17 If any of you have been to Los Angeles  crosstalk 00 36 22  20 years ago  you'll remember  that sky was brown  You go there now the sky is blue  You know why  Because leader decided to lead  We took on these big fossil fuel companies  We have some of the most important and strongest laws  16   in the country  0 We made a difference  My point being I've done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time  The clock is ticking  9  crosstalk 00 36 48    but we need courage and we need courageous leadership  We can get this done  4 My first grade teacher  Mrs  Francis Wilson  God rest her soul  attended my law school graduation  I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us  I have offered  in this campaign  a proposal to deal with this  which will be the first in the nation  Federal investment enclosing the teacher pay gap  Which is  13 500 a year  Because right now in our public schools our teachers  94  of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies  That is wrong  32 I also want to talk about where we are here at TSU and what it means in terms of HBCUs  I have  as part of my proposal  that we will put two trillion dollars into investing in our HBCUs for teachers  Because one  as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university I will say that is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions  But also  31 But this is a critical point  If a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade they are 13  more likely to go to college  If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade they are 32  more likely to go to college  When we talk about investing in our public education system it is at the source of so much  When we fix it that will fix so many other things  We must invest in the potential  32   of our children  0 I strongly believe you can judge a  crosstalk 00 43 58  society based on how it treats its children and we are  5   failing on this issue  7 Every office I've run for  whether it be district attorney or attorney general  I was told each time it can't be done  They said   Nobody like you has done it before  You're   nobody is ready for you   When I ran for DA  I won and became the first Black woman elected DA in a state of 40 million people in San Francisco  When I ran for Attorney General of California  I was elected because I didn't listen  I was the only Black elected woman  Black elected attorney general in the state  in the country  39 Each time people would say   It's not your time  It's not your turn  It's going to be too difficult  They're not ready for you   I didn't listen  A part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me  including   Don't you ever let anybody tell you who you are  You tell them who you are   24 When I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States and I look at the meetings that we do and the community meetings and I see these little girls and boys sometimes even brought by their fathers  They bring them to me  and I talk to them during these events and they smile  They're full of joy and their fathers tell them   See  don't you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be  You have to believe in what can be unburdened by what has been   34 This is an inflection moment in the history of our country  I think we all know that  This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask the question  that question being  who are we  And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this  So this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course we will  And this is not a new fight for us as Americans  We have always been prepared to fight for our ideals  We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are  And I'll tell you  I come from fighters  My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement  My sister Maya and I joke  we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults  who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice  And I am prepared to march with you  to fight with you for the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of Donald Trump and against him  69 Well  they're probably confused because they've not read it  but the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families  Listening to experts  listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people  Responsive to their needs  understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long  That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy  37 I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan  So I devised a plan where it's going to be 10 years of a transition  I listened to American families who said  I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan  So I designed a plan where yes  responsive to the needs of American families  there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare  Because the bottom line is this  we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it  And in America today  far too many people  in fact  30 million people are going without access to healthcare  44 Absolutely  Unfortunately  Vice President Biden  you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing  The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare For All system  Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day  Babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in America or every year in America  Under our plan  we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare  Your plan by contrast  leaves out almost 10 million Americans  So I think that you should really think about what you're saying  but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to healthcare and do not want costs to be their barrier to getting it  43 I'd like to respond  First of all  the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive  Second  we are now paying  3 trillion a year for healthcare in America  Over the next 10 years  it's probably going to be  6 trillion  We must act  My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage  Right now in America  we have seniors who everyday  millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need  All people should have access to healthcare and and costs should not be  36 In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act  it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective way to bring healthcare to all  Kathleen Sibelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go  In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising  I couldn't agree more  Senator Biden  your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo  doing business as usual  And that's going to be about jacking up copays  jacking up deductibles  36 It will still be the situation  2 That people going to an emergency room have to come out  5 000  2 Well  unfortunately Representative Gabbard got it wrong  Kathleen Sibelius did not write my plan  she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone's going to have access to healthcare in America  And when we talk about this again  I'm going to go back to Vice President Biden  because your plan does not cover everyone in America  by your staff's and your own definition  10 million people  as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare  And in 2019 in America  for a Democrat to be running for President with a plan that does not cover everyone  I think is without excuse  43 Our plan covers everyone  1 And gives people choice  1 I need to respond  1 Well  first of all with all due respect to my friend Michael Bennet  my plan does not offer anything that is illegal  What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare  meaning that where you work will not be a  the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work  I have met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like  where they are not prospering  simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides  26 It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get  and under my plan  we do that  As it relates to the insurance and pharmaceutical companies  8 Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennet's plan  7 We will do that  3 We cannot keep with the Republican talking points on this  You got to stop  The reality is that under my Medicare for All plan  yes  Employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get  They will be able to make that decision  Private insurance companies and private carriers  if they comply by our rules and play by our rules  we'll be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan  or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan  But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only  they want choice and my plan gives that to them  38 Yeah  let's talk about math  Let's talk about math  Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year along profited  72 billion dollars  and that is on the backs of American families  And under your plan  status quo  you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families  In America today  a diabetes patient  one in four cannot afford their insulin  In America today  33 For those people who have overdosed from an opioid  there is a syringe that costs  4 000  4 That will save their life  It is immoral  it is untenable  3 And it must change with Medicare for All  2 Vice President Biden  your response  1 Well  again  with all due respect  after the last debate for example  I went to a place in Florida called Homestead  There is a private detention facility being paid for by your tax payer dollars  a private detention facility that currently houses 2700 children  By the way  there were members of us  Julian was there  members of Congress  They would not let us enter the place  members of the United States Congress  So I walked down the road  I climbed a ladder and I looked over the fence and I'm going to tell you what I saw  34 I saw children lined up single file based on gender  being walked into barracks  The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the book that allow them to be incarcerated as though they've committed crimes  14 These children have not committed crimes and should be not treated like criminals  4 That is simply false and let's be very clear about this  When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationist to oppose busing  which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools  had I been in the United States Senate at that time  I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle  And let's be clear about this  had those segregationists their way  I would not be a member of the United States Senate  Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate and Barack Obama would not have been in a position to nominate him for the title he now holds  35 And so  on that issue  we could not be more apart  which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time  Now I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner because I too met with his mother  and one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this President of the United States  Donald Trump  while he has been in office  has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees  to stop pattern and practice investigations on that case  35 We also know that the  crosstalk 00 12 40  civil rights division  this is important  the civil rights division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed  but this United States Department of Justice usurped  and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward and they overrode a decision by the civil rights division of the United States  crosstalk 00 12 58  Department of Justice  Under my administration the civil rights  crosstalk 00 13 01  will reign and there will be independent investigations  26 That is simply not true and as Attorney General of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States  second only to the United States Department of Justice  I am proud of the work we did  Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades  26 It was the work of creating one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling  7 I did the work as Attorney General of putting body cameras  3 On special agents  crosstalk 00 14 46  in the state of California and I'm proud of that work  4 As the elected Attorney General of California  I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people  which became a national model for the work that needs to be done  And I am proud of that work and I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor  but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform  29 That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling  6 It is why and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken  3 That I am an advocate for what  crosstalk 00 16 35  we need to do to not only  crosstalk 00 16 36  but legalize marijuana in the United States  8 My entire career I have been  2 Adopt a green new deal on day one as president  2 I would reenter us in the Paris Agreement  2 And put in place so we would be carbon neutral by 2030  3 Thank you senator  Mayor de Blasio  your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in New York City public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead  As you know  we're not far from Flint  Michigan  where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water  How can you assure the people of Flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem  27 First of all  Donald Trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep  He said he was going to help farmers  He said he was going to help auto workers  Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy  soybeans rotting in bales  Auto workers  we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year  Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates  and he admitted why  because of this so called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as  1 4 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines  He betrayed the American people  he betrayed American families  and he will lose this election  because folks are clear that he has done nothing except try to beat people down instead of lift people up  And that's what we want in the next president of the United States  51 I think that supported my proposal  which is this  since 1963 when we passed the Equal Pay Act we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work  Fast forward to the Year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar  Black women  61 cents  Native American woman  58 cents  Latinas  53 cents  I'm done with the conversation  So  yes  I am proposing in order to deal with this  one  I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work  Two  they will be fined  For every 1  differential between what they're paying men and women they will be find 1  of their previous year's profits  That'll get everybody's attention  43 Time for action  1 Well  I just  Listen  I mean  talk about now running for president and you change your position  On the Hyde Amendment  Vice President  where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest  Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that  Because you've only  since you've been running for president this time  said that you in some way would take that back or you didn't agree with the decision that you made over many  many years  34 And this directly impacted so many women in our country  And I personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases  And the experience that those women have  those children have  and that they would then be denied the resources  14 I think is unacceptable  3 Well  why did it take you so long to change your position on the Hyde Amendment  Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde Amendment  9 Okay  0 Well  I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do  But listen  look  we all watched his testimony  I read the report  There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable  I've seen people go to prison for far less  And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted  I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law  including the President of the United States  40 So in my background as Attorney General of California  I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners  many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another  I've taken on the for profit colleges who preyed on students  put them out of business  I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children  And I will tell you  we have a predator living in the White House  26 And I'm going to tell you something  Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts  And the thing about predators is this  by their very nature  they prey on people they perceive to be weak  They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable  They prey on people who are in need of help  often desperate for help  And predators are cowards  What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years  38 And let me tell you  we've got a long rap sheet  We're looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1  and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families  We've got a person who was put babies in cages and separated children from their parents  We have someone who passed his so called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families  25 So we must defeat him  And then in turning the page  write the next chapter for our country  And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at three o'clock in the morning  And that is my agenda  The 3 00 AM agenda that is focused on getting folks the jobs they need  getting their children the education they need  making sure they have the healthcare they need  and the future they deserve  So please join me at kamalaharris org and I thank you for your time  30 Well  let me tell you something  I hear that question  but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1   and the biggest corporations in this country  contributing at least  1 trillion to the debt of America  which middle class families will pay for one way or another  20 Working families need support and need to be lifted up  and frankly  this economy is not working for working people  For too long  the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most  and not in favor of the people who work the most  which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code  19 So for every family that is making less than  100 000 a year  they will receive a tax credit that they can collect  500 a month  which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support  or not  And on day one  I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1   and the biggest corporations of America  19 Hey guys  you know what  America does not want to witness a food fight  they want to know how we're going to put food on their table  On that point  part of the issue that is at play in America today  and we've all been traveling around the country  I certainly have  I'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs  You know  this President walks around talking about and flouting his great economy  right  My great economy  my great economy  You ask him   Well  how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours   And he talks about the stock market  38 Well  that's fine if you own stocks  So many families in America do not  You ask him   How are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours   And they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers  Well  yeah  people in America are working  They're working two and three jobs  So when we talk about jobs  let's be really clear  in our America  no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table  22 I'd like to add a point  0 I'd like to add a point  1 I would like to add a point here  0  And the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard  and I will paraphrase  There is  any night in America  a parent who's seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control  calls 9 1 1   What should I do   They say   Take the child to the emergency room   19 So they get in their car and they drive  and they're sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors  while they have the hand on the forehead of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors  even though they have insurance  they will be out of  5 000 00 deductible    5 000 00 deductible when they walk through those doors  23 That's what insurance companies are doing  2 Immediately  on January 20  2021  I will first off  We cannot forget our DACA recipients  so I'm going to start there  I will immediately  by executive action  reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people  I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents  and for veterans  who we have so many who are undocumented and have served our country and fought for our democracy  30 I will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum  I will release children from cages  I will get rid of the private detention centers  And I will ensure that with this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand  is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country  and not about locking children up  separating them from  29 And not about locking children up  separating them from their parents  And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people  A mother  who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin  through the entire country of Mexico  facing unknown peril  to come here  Why would that mother do that  I will tell you  Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse  But what does Donald Trump do  He says   Go back to where you came from   That is not reflective of our America  and our values  and it's got to end  41 Well  thank you  I will say no  absolutely not  They should not be deported  And I actually  This was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration  with whom I otherwise had great relationship  and a great deal of respect  But on the secure communities issue  I was Attorney General of California  I led the second largest Department of Justice in The United States  second only to The United States Department of Justice in a state of 40 million people  And on this issue  I disagreed with my President  because the policy was to allow deportation of people  who by ICE's own definition were non criminals  39 So as attorney general  and the Chief Law Officer of the state of California  I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state  that they did not have to comply with detainers  and instead  should make decisions based on the best interest of public safely of their community  Because what I saw  and I was tracking it every day  I was tracking it and saw that parents  people who had not committed a crime  even by ICE's own definition  were being deported  28 But I have to add a point here  The problem with this kind of policy  and I know it as a prosecutor  I want rape victim to be able to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her  I want anybody who has been the victim of any real crime to be able to do that  and not be afraid that if they do that  they will be deported  because the abuser will tell them it is they who is the criminal  It is wrong  It is wrong  30  crosstalk 00 03 48  stage I would like to speak on the issue of race  2 What I will say is that I  crosstalk 00 03 57   2 Okay  On the issue of race I couldn't agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly  There is not a black man I know  be he a relative  a friend  or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination  19 Growing up my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents said couldn't play with us because we were black  8 I will say also that in this campaign we've also heard   I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden  I do not believe you are a racist  I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground  18 I also believe   It's personal  It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country  19 It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing  There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools  She was bused to school every day  That little girl was me  22 I will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats  We have to take it seriously  We have to act swiftly  As Attorney General of California  I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on  19 Vice President Biden  do you agree today  do you agree today  that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then  9 Do you agree  1 Well  there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America  I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley  California public schools almost two decades after Brown v  Board of Education  12 That's where the federal government must step in  6 That's why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act  That's why we need to pass the Equality Act  That's why we need to pass the ERA because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people  10 Well  first of all  I don't even call it climate change  It's the climate crisis  It represents an existential threat to us as a species  The fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact would be to our collective peril  15 I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California  I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning  13 On this issue it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now  That is why I support a Green New Deal  It is why I believe on day one and as president I will reenter us in the Paris Agreement because we have to take these issues seriously  20 Frankly  we have a President of the United States   We talked about  you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States  It's Donald Trump  8 I'm going to tell you why  I'm going to tell you why  because I agree climate change represents an existential threat  He denies the science  You want to talk about North Korea  A real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what does he do  He embraces Kim Jong Un  a dictator for the sake of a photo op  Putin  you want   18  a dictator for the sake of a photo op  0 Putin  You want to talk about Russia  5 He takes the word of the Russian President  0 Over the word of the American intelligence  2 Community when it comes to a threat to our democracy  2 And our elections  1 These are the issues that are before us  Chuck  2 Yes  0  campaigns of the Republican Party  1 Oh  I like that  Okay  4 Passing a middle class  working families tax cut  3 DACA  guns  4 Thank you  I think your idea is a great one  Congressman Swalwell  I will say that there a lot of great ideas  The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act  which is why when elected President of the United States  I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together  bring all these good ideas together  and put a bill on my desk for signature  If they do not  I will take executive action  and I will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy we've had  I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law  and I will ban  by executive order  the importation of assault weapons  because I'm going to tell you  as a prosecutor  I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you  I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims  I have attended more police officer funerals  It is enough  It is enough  There have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress  There's been no action  As President  I will take action  57 All the members of the NATO alliance  3 Thank you  I just want to leave you with a couple of things  One  we need a nominee who has the ability to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and I will do that  Second  this election is about you  This is about your hopes  and your dreams  and your fears  and what wakes you up at three o'clock in the morning  That's why I have what I call a 3 00 a m  agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month  When I think about what our country needs  I promise you I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity  with honesty  speaking the truth  and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper  59 So  I hope to earn your support  Please join us kamalaharris org  4 
Cory Booker,Well  first of all  I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country  We actually have a real problem with the tax rates  tax loopholes  tax cheats  and I don't agree with the wealth tax the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it  but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax  We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income  Real strategies will increase revenue  But here's the challenge  We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system  But as I travel around the country  we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth as well  33 When I stood in church recently  and asked folks in a black church  how many people here want to be entrepreneurs  Half the church raised their hands  If we as a country don't start  if we as a party  don't start talking  not just about how to tax wealth  but to give more people opportunities to create wealth  to grow businesses  to have their American dream  Because yeah  we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage   15 an hour  But the people in communities I frequent  they're not aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages  They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth  but they want to have equalities of opportunity  And that's what our party has to be about as well  40 You know  again  I agree with the need to do all of those things  We're all united in wanting to see universal preschool  and I'll fight for that  We're all united in wanting to fund HBCUs  Heck  I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for two parents that went to HBCUs  But the tax  the way we're putting the forward right now  the wealth tax  I'm sorry  it's cumbersome  It's been tried by other nations  It's hard to evaluate  We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation  But again  we as Democrats have got to start talking  not just about how we tax from a stage  but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it  35 Look at VC dollars in this country  75  of them go to the three metropolitan areas  There is worth in the inner city  There is value in our rural areas  If I am President of the United States  we're going to have a fair just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share  but dear God  we're going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans  We're going to see a change in what we see right now  Small businesses  new startups are going down in this country  26 We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth  0 I'm not disagreeing with that  0 But everybody is tired of freeloading billionaires  Everybody's tired of corporations paying zero taxes  I'm not disagreeing with that  7 So look  this president has broken norms as you've said  He used this platform to demean  degrade and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling  But the next president  whoever they are  is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together  this whole nation  So absolutely in that office  I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together  But it's not for a kumbaya moment  We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together  37 So absolutely  When I was mayor of the largest city in my state  and this is where I agree with mayor Pete  Mayoral experience is very important  And I happened to be the other road scholar mayor on this stage  And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal  In my city  we have racial divides  We have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling  The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn't be done  When I am president United States  my campaign from the very beginning has not changed  My charge is to see a nation right now  which has so much common pain to channel that back into a sense of common purpose and I will do whatever it takes  Bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before  53 I'm so grateful again as a mayor  who was a mayor during the recession  who was a mayor during a housing crisis who started my career as a tenants' rights lawyer  This are all good points  but we're not talking about something that is going on all over America  which is gentrification and low income families being moved further and further out  often compounding racial segregation  And so all of these things  we need to put more federal dollars in it  but we've got to start empowering people  25 We use our tax code to move wealth up the mortgage interest deduction  My plan is very simple  If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent  then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying in the area meeting your rent  That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners and what that does is it actually slashes poverty  10 million people out  and by the way  for those people who are facing eviction  it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord  It is also low income families struggling to stay in their home  37 Well  first of all  this is a president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and in fact  attacking them as well  We use a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada  At the very time that China is breaking international rules  is practicing unfair practices  stealing technology  forcing technology transfer and violating human rights  this nation is pulling away from critical allies  We would need to show strength against China  There's a larger battle going on on the planet earth right now between totalitarian and dictatorial countries and free democracies  and we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good  with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government with its leader now getting rid of term limits  49 I believe we need a much stronger policy  One that's not led as president Trump seems to want to do in a transactional way  but one that's led by American values  Yes  we will call China out for human rights violations  but not only that  we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights  Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border  children are thrown in cages  It's a human rights violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization to the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children  It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy or what we are going to lead with  and begin to check China  check Putin and the other folks who are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe  51 Can I respond to Buttigieg  1 Look  I want to be quick on this because I'd like to get back to something that I wasn't included in  is  5 Absolutely  if this is not effective  we see people cutting holes in this wall  his wall  the way he brags about it  it's just wrong  We need to have policies that respect dignity  keep us safe and strong  I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters  I have a lifetime of experience with black voters  I've been one since I was 18  Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters  Black voters are pissed off and they're worried  They're pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote  34 And they're worried because the Democratic Party  we don't want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isn't trusted  doesn't have authentic connection  That's what's on the ballot and issues do matter  I have a lot of respect for the Vice President  He has sworn me into my office as a hero  This week I hear him literally say that I don't think we should legalize marijuana  I thought you might've been high when you said it  31 And let me tell you  because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people  And it's what the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people  And let me say this  there's more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850  do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children  32 Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana  while there are people  our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes  These are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community and if we don't have somebody authentically  we lost the last election  Let me just give you this data example  18 We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive dimunition  a lot of reasons  but there was a massive dimunition in the African American vote  We need to have someone that can inspire  as Kamala said  to inspire African Americans to the polls in record numbers  14 That's not true  not true  0 This is a voting issue  3 This is a voting issue  This is a voter suppression issue  Right here in this great state of Georgia  it was the voter suppression  particularly of African American communities  that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams  right now  That is  when you have undemocratic needs  when you suppress people's votes to get elected  those are the very people you're going to come after when you're in office  This bill opposed by over 70   The Heartbeat Bill here opposed by over 70  of Georgians  is the result from voter suppression  This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day  that whoever is the nominee  they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes  particularly of low income and minority voters and particularly in the black community like we saw here in Georgia  46 Thank you  Rachel  It's an honor to be here tonight  I have not yet qualified for the December stage  I need your help to do that  If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here  please go to CoryBooker com  please help  I had a closing statement prepared  but I saw in the audience during the break  a man named John Lewis  Perhaps it's interesting and important for me to mention why I'm so grateful to him  I've been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change  not just beat Donald Trump  That's the floor  We need to go to the ceiling  We need to go to the mountaintop  I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago  there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life  changed his mind to get up and start representing families  one of them  mine  who are discriminated against  The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer's activity  49 When I asked him why  why he did what he did  he told me that on March 7th  1965  he was watching a movie called Judgment at Nuremberg on TV  They interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge  There he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers  We all owe a debt that we cannot repay  We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig  This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again  that we have truly a moral moment in America like it was back in 1965  If you give me a chance to lead  I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble  I will challenge us  I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before   54  NAME  9 So first of all  we must be fair  We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office  This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship  Look  I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage  I understand the outrage that we all feel  but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable  that brings our country together  doesn't rip us apart  Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public  that works to build consensus  That's what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one  So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator  do my duty  This president has violated his  I will do mine  51 It is wrong to move on  2 Well  first of all  I'm happy to get in  finally  I just want to say  as a great New Jerseyan  Yogi Berra  said   I am having deja vu all over again   I'm having days of Google all over again  first of all  because I saw this play in 2016's election  We are literally using Donald Trump's lies  and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman  That was so offensive  He should not have to defend ourselves  The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump  seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and the selling out of his office  33 I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another healthcare debate and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close  We are seeing  all over this country  women's reproductive rights under attack  God bless Kamala  but you know what  Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight  Men  24  it is not just because women are our daughters  3  NAME  7 Well  first of all  the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation  and I hope that my friend Andrew Yang will come out for this  Doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to  15 an hour  It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them  1 000 a month  We have to start putting the dignity back in work  Number one  you start having trade deals  Not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal  We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country  but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed  46 But it's more than that  I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country  I stood with unions because right now  unions in America are under attack  As union membership has gone down  we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country  So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread  to make sure we have sectorial bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country  36 Well  first of all  I just want to respond by  You know  we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one term president  How we talk about each other in this debate actually  really matters  I've had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage  and tearing each other down because we have a different plan  to me  is unacceptable  I have seen this script before  It didn't work in 2016 and it will be disaster for us in 2020  29 I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren  I have a different plan than many people on this stage  It involves  again  fair taxes for the richest  We have a lot of work to do there  but we've had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty  We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure a fair taxes are paid by people on the top  but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world  My plan will focus on that  and these are some of the issues we should be talking about  not defining ourselves just by what we're against  but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for  44 So first of all  understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire  We literally have great generals  like Mattis  who said on the world stage   The United States of America  There can be no better friend than the United States of America  and no greater enemy than the United States of America   This President has turned that upside down  and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances  and partner with Russia  30 And so clearly  to your question  number one  we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow and influence by abandoning the world stage  We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine  and Latvia  and Lithuania  but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable  Russia and Putin understand strength  and this President  time and time again  is showing moral weakness  31 He makes promises to the American people  that he's going to protect this nation  Well  instead of doing something to defeat ISIS  he's now given them a foothold again  This is an American President that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he's bringing our troops home  At the same time  he's increasing true presence with the Saudis while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen  This president is making us less safe  He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron  As President of the United States  I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad  36 Look  I again worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown  There's a young man in my neighborhood   I watched him grow up  I lived in some high rise projects with him   named Shahad  and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle  I'm living with a sense of urgency on this problem  because when I go home to my community  like millions of Americans  we live in communities where these weapons  where these gunshots are real every single day  And I know where the American public is  29 This is not about leadership  This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us  I'm not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues  We all have courage  but it's frustrating that when the American people  77  of Americans agree on licensing  We don't need leadership right now  We just need folks who are going to stand up and follow where the people already are  because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare  where we're surrendering our freedoms  27   to fear in this country  This is the first time in American history  this fall  where we have sent our children to school  the strongest nation on the planet Earth  and said to them   We can't protect you  11   so in school we're going to teach you how to hide   There are more duck and cover drills and shelter in place drills in America now than fire drills  7 If I'm President of the United States  I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure we end the scourge of mass violence  7 And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana  I want to make sure that's clear  as well  3 Anybody that does not think that we hae a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used  not just in terms of anti competitive practices  but also to undermine our democracy  We have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now  We need regulation and reform  Antitrust  I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep  We have a reality in this country where antitrust  from pharma to farms  is causing trouble  We have to deal with this  As president of the United States I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws  36 I want to say one last thing  and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage  going back to the fact that we   It's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump  17 Well first of all let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio  they're not just a tax on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country liberty  the ability to control your own body  but they are particular another example of people trying to punish  trying to penalize  trying to criminalize poverty  Because this is disproportionately affecting low income women in this country  people in rural areas in this country  It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal  that human beings should control their own body  30 The way  as president of the United States  I'm going to deal with this is first of all elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position  I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in The White House  Make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt  that's gone on for decades  to undermine Roe v  Wade  I will fight to codify it  I will also make sure that we fight  as this country  to repeal the Hyde Amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global  32   assault we see on women right now  1 Well  look  I have so many  I don't even know where to count  I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor  he and I had to form a friendship even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements  When I got to the United States Senate  I went there with a purpose of making friendships across the aisle  I go to Bible study and chairman in Hoff's office  He and I passed legislation together to help homeless and foster kids  I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner and let me again say  finding a dinner in a restaurant  agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing  I'm a vegan and he's a meat eating Texan  but I'll tell you this right now  this is the moment in America that this is our test  the spirit of our country  I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self reliance  but think about our history  46 Rugged individualism didn't get us to the moon  It didn't beat the Nazis  It didn't map the human genome  It didn't beat Jim Crow  Everything we did in this country  big and vice president  we have done so many big things  The fact that there's an openly gay man now  black woman  all of us on the stage or because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose  This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office  it's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other  The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all  not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country  Teach us a more courageous empathy and remind America that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow country men and women and love is not sentimentality  it's not anemic  Love is struggle  60 Love is sacrifice  Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the declaration of independence that if we're ever going to make it as a nation  we must mutually pledge to each other our lives  our fortunes and our sacred honor  I am running for president to restore that sacred honor and if you believe in not like I do  please join me by going to corybooker com  Thank you  22 We have overcome worse times and darker moments than this  4 It was over twenty years ago that I was a law student  and moved to inner city Newark  New Jersey  to serve as a tenants' rights lawyer  to try to address the challenges in my community  I was sobered by them  The gun violence  the substandard housing  but it was my greatest mentor  a woman named Ms  Virginia Jones  who challenged me  She said   Boy  if all you see in this neighborhood is problems  that's all there's ever going to be  but if you're stubborn  and defiant  and can put forth a vision that can unify people  then we can make transformative change   She was a church woman that said   Without vision  the people will perish   35 Well  that's exactly what we did  We created extraordinary unity in our community  and we did things that other people thought were impossible  That's the story of America  At our best  we unify  We find common cause and common purpose  The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party  Not just to beat Donald Trump  but to unite America in common cause and common purpose  That's why I'm running for president  and that's how I will lead this nation  37 Thank you very much  Look  there are a lot of people watching at home right now  listening to us  that are afraid because they are in crisis  They don't have health insurance  or health insurance doesn't go far enough  they can't afford their prescription drugs  Look  I'm clear on what I believe  I believe in Medicare for All  I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system  but dear god  I know that every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage  and comes at this with the best of intentions  I'll tell you  there is an urgency right now in this nation  Everybody feels it  As a person who has an ideal  I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the alter of purity  because people in my community  they need help right now  43 They have high blood pressure right now  They have unaffordable insulin right now  And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground  but find common ground  because we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one  term president  and we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other  or demonize and degrade each other  We can walk and chew gum at the same time  If I am the leader I will work towards the ideal of health insurance  health coverage being a right for all Americans  but every single day I'll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today  42 Well  first and foremost  I want to hit that point  because we know Donald Trump's a racist  but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that  Racism exists  the question isn't  Who isn't a racist   it's  Who is and isn't doing something about racism   And this is not just an issue that started yesterday  It's not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy  We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation  from healthcare to the criminal justice system  And it's nice to go all the way back to slavey  but dear god  we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we have more African Americans under criminal supervision today that all the slaves in 1850  44 We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism  having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it  If I am President of the United States  we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes  and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare  to even one that we don't talk about enough  which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country  35 Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken  There's no difference in American between blacks  whites  and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs  but if you're African American you're almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated  destroying your lives  And so much of this comes down to privilege  We have a criminal justice system that Bryan Stevenson says  Treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent   So I have challenged this whole field  We can specifically and demonstratively now show that there are 17000 people unjustly incarcerated in America  and all of us should come forward and say  When I am President of the United States we will release them   and let me be specific  I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass onto this president for criminal justice reform  that has already led to 1000s of people coming out of jail  49 If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it  but we didn't make it retractive  we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now  Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17000 people  and I challenge you  don't just say big statements  back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation  which is liberty and freedom  We need to reform this system and we must do it now  Every day we wait is too long  36 So background checks and gun licensing  these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans  83  of Americans agree with licensing  This is the issue  Look  I grew up in the suburbs  It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city New Jersey  and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting  It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades  this has been a crisis for me  It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing  And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing  but this is what I'm sorry about  I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change  This is a crisis of empathy in our nation  53 We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood  our community before we demand action  You want to know how we get this done  We get this done by having a more courageous empathy where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities  They stand up and understand the truth of what King said  that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere  I will lead change on this issue because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine  Because we forget national shootings  these mass shootings or tragedies  but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine  Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue  I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before  54 If that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights  If it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate  I'm looking to lead a movement  The number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry  Think about this  We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the revolutionary war till now  This is not a side issue to me  it is a central issue to me  That is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims  we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine  36 We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country  so we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency  Because the majority of Americans  the majority of gun owners agree with me  not the corporate gun lobby  It is time for a movement on this issue and I will lead it  19 Sure  1 There's one point we're really missing on this stage right now  which is the fact that Donald Trump's America First policy is actually an America isolated  an America alone policy   crosstalk 00 12 26   11 From trade  to battling China  to the global crisis of climate change  the challenges in the Middle East  He is pulling us away from our allies  out of the Iran deal  out of the Paris climate accords  And on trade he's deciding to take on China while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies  21 You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada  Now look  I'm the only person on the stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing  but they are not a national security threat  We cannot go up against China alone  This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators like Duterte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron  24 We are the strongest nation on the planet earth and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose  That's how we beat China  that's how we beat climate change on the planet earth and that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers' rights  19 First of all  I want to say no  Actually  I want to translate that into Spanish  No  Look  let's just be clear  the factory farming going on that's assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry  one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment  And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don't line up with our values  That's what I'm calling for  39 But I want to switch  because we don't have   a crowded debate stage  We were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq  It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country  We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds  hurts and harms  They're disproportionately homeless  You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA  It is very important that we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism  that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us  We end our national anthem with  home of the brave   It's about time we make this a better home for our bravest  51 I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage and the way we talk about communities of color  Look I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line  I've lived in  Polk 00 50 10  Housing Projects for almost a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius  I think I'm the only person on the stage  even though I had no formal authority as Mayor to run a school system  I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools  We produce results  31 A lot of folks here talking about raising teachers salary  We actually did it in Newark  New Jersey  We didn't stop there  We closed poor performing charter schools  but dagnabbit we expanded high performing charter schools  We were a city that said   We need to find local solutions that work for our community   The results speak for themselves  We're now the number one city in America for Beat the Odds schools  From high poverty to high performance  Strategies like investing in our children work  28 I'll tell you this  I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated  disconnected from the other issues  That's why my friend Secretary Castro is 100  right  We are in the reality we are right now because Vice President of overtly racist policies  not 400 years ago just in my lifetime  That were redlining communities  disinvesting in communities  More than just that  my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation  and housing  and the challenges of underfunded schools  but they're also struggling with environmental injustice  If you've talked to someone who's a parent of a child who has had permanent brain damage because of lead  you'll know this is a national problem because there's over 3 000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint  Michigan  47 If I'm President of the United States it is a holistic solution to education  From raising teachers' salary  fully funded special education  but combating the issues of poverty  combating the issues of racial segregation  combating the issues of a criminal justice system that takes  14   parents away from their kids  Dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy  6 My biggest professional setback is embarrassing  because a lot of folks know about it  I  with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark  New Jersey in 2002  took on the political machine  Boy  did they fight back  I had tires on my car slashed  Our campaign offices were broken into  My phones were tapped  It became a spectacle  and we lost that election  Here's a bit of advice to everybody  If you're going to have a spectacular failure  have a documentary team there to capture it because it made for an Oscar nominated documentary called Street Fight  But hen unfortunately  another setback  it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dag nab Penguins  for crying out loud  38 The people in my community of living in the projects told me   Don't give up on the people  and the people won't give up on you  Create bigger and bolder coalitions  and you're going to win   You know what  We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our city's history  17 More than that  the lesson was there  We didn't give up  We were taking on America's toughest problems from crime to poverty  We transformed our city  creating tens of thousands of new jobs  the biggest economic expansion in our city  and as I said before  turned around our school system  There's more work to do  but I haven't given up on the people  I still live in that community  19 This is the big lesson  My staff and my friends and my community told me   If you want to go fast  you may have won the mayor's race  but that's not what life is about   There's an old African saying that says   If you want to go fast  go alone  But if you want to go far  go together   The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people  because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power  The test of America right now  it's not a referendum on Donald Trump  It's a referendum on us and who we are and who we're going to be together  We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose  and then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation  37 Thank you Dana  Last week  the President of the United States attacked an American city calling it a disgusting  rat infested rodent mess  We need a nation that understands that these tired old language  30 I will stand by  1 Thank you very much  Donald Trump from Charleston to Baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demagogues  of fear mongers  of racists to try to divide our country against itself  We know who Donald Trump is but in this election the question is who are we as a people  We have serious problems in America  We have deep wounds and seriously  deeply rooted challenges  We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward  Because we know in this country that our fates are united  that we have a common destiny  The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose  That's how we will beat Donald Trump  That's how I will beat Donald Trump and as your president  that's how I will govern and move us forward together  71 Well  first of all  let me just say that the person that's enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump  as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now to take away Americans' healthcare  There's a court case working through the system that's going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on pre existing conditions  And so I was raised by two Civil Rights parents who told me to always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that the United States of America  every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare  That it's a human right  And how we get there  it has to be to end this broken system  because we are on our way in just a handful of years  of literally spending 20  of our economy  one out of every  5 spent on healthcare  49 And we spend more than every other nation  on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs  multiple more than other countries  And so you want to know what I'm going to do  I'm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for all  where everyone is covered  But this pitting against progressives against moderates  saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough  that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here  26  crosstalk 00 24 31  And I'm going to keep fighting for that  1 Well first of all  I just want to say again tonight we are playing into Republican hands  who have a very different view and they're trying to divide us against each other  I'm listening to the language of my colleagues  No  Mr  Vice President  we are not going to just let people cross the border  17 And unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts  or if you do it through the criminal courts  But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country  who no one surrenders their human rights  17 And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities  that I've been to  seeing children sleeping on pavement  people being put in cages  nursing mothers  small children  This is not necessary  We have seen  using the civil system  piloted programs that have 100  compliance with the civil courts  where people are evaluated  If they have no justifiable reason to be here  they are returned  30 If they are  like the people I met in Juarez who were survivors of sexual assault  who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum  We are butchering our values  and making ourselves less safe  12 Well  a couple things  First of all  Mr  Vice President  you can't have it both ways  You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign  You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not  10 And the second thing  and this really irks me  because I heard the Vice President say that if you've got a PhD  you can come right into this country  Well that's playing into what the Republicans want  to pit some immigrants against other immigrants  Some are from shit hole countries  and some are from worthy countries  16 We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity  and this should be a country that honors for everyone  Don't let the Republicans divide this party against itself  13 Well  my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty  mental health and addiction  with locking people up and not lifting them up  And Mr  Vice President has said that since the 1970s  every major crime bill  every crime bill  major and minor  has had his name on it  And so those are your words  not mine  And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire  and you claimed responsibility for those laws  And you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire  40 We have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform  like having  6   true marijuana justice  which means that  3   we legalize it on a federal level  2   and reinvest the profits in communities  2   that have been disproportionately targeted by marijuana enforcement  3 Well  first of all  I'm grateful that he endorsed my presidency already  but I'll tell you this  It's no secret that I inherited a criminal   a police department with massive problems and decades long challenges  But the head of the ACLU has already said  the head of the New Jersey ACLU  that I put forth national standards setting accountability  Mr  Vice President  21 Mr  Vice President  I didn't interrupt you  2 Please show me that respect  sir  We have a system right now that's broken  and if you want to compare records  and frankly  I'm shocked that you do  I am happy to do that because all the problems that he is talking about that he created  I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you are frankly to correct you  Mr  Vice President  you are bragging  calling it the Biden crime bill up until 2015  27 Mr  Vice President  there's a saying in my community  you're dipping into the Kool Aid  and you don't even know the flavor  7 You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place  The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms  not just in action  but in deed  Sir  you are trying to shift the view from what you created  15 There are people right now in prison for life  for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime  phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroy communities like mine  This isn't about the past  sir  This is about the present right now  18 I believe in redemption  1 I'm happy you evolved  1   but you offered no redemption to the people in prison right now for life  3 I just want to take  first of all  a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee  and it's one of the reasons why Greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field  crosstalk 00 19 58  I want to say very clearly  thank you man  thank you  I'll try harder  Look  the reason why is because first of all  this problem didn't start yesterday  Science didn't become a reality yesterday  This has been going on for years  There was another president that would not join an international accord  Then it was the Kyoto accord  I was mayor then and I stood up in national leadership  joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue  41 It must be the issue and the lens with which you view every issue  Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords  that is kindergarten  We have to go to far advance and makes sure that everything from our trade deals  everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid  everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential  which is dealing with the climate threat  And yes  the majority of this problem is outside the United States  but the only way we're going to deal with this  29 Is that the United States leads  2 I'm grateful  I'm grateful  Jake  look  this is one of those times where we're not staring at the truth and calling it out  and this is a case for the Democratic Party  the truth will set us free  We lost the State of Michigan  because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters  We need to say that  If the African American vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier  we would have won the State of Michigan  We need to have a campaign that is ready for what's coming  an all out assault  especially on the most valuable voter group in our  in fact  the highest performing voter group in our coalition  which is black women  And so I will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression  that can activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions that are going to win states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  53 Well  first of all  I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time  A guy that literally tweets out that we're pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it  is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan  And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible  But I will not set  during a campaign  an artificial deadline  I will make sure we do it  we do it expeditiously  We do it safely to not create a vacuum that's ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and  perhaps  create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation  40 My response is exactly that  I've read the report  I've read the redacted versions of the report  We have something that is astonishing going on the United States of America  We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world  He's acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold  And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage  I believe that we  in the United States Congress  should start impeachment proceedings immediately  And I'll tell you this  Debbie Stabenow has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings  Because he is now stonewalling congress  not allowing or subjecting himself to the checks and balances  We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution  The politics of this be damned  When we look back in history at what happened when a President of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world  the question is what will we have done  And I believe the congress should do its job  59 Thank you  First  I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit  They're hosting us today  And one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities  including the city of Newark  And Detroit is turning around  And Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us  no one demean or degrade us  or underestimate our worth  We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause  29 That's the history of this city  My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit  born to a guy that was a UAW worker  My grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression  My grandmother joined him  She was really entrepreneurial  opened a pool hall and a laundry mat right here in this city  That is the American dream  And so many of us have stories like that  But the dream of this country is under threat right now  29 Well  my mom's generation  80  95  of baby boomers did better than their parents  It's now just a coin toss for millennials  We have a real crises in our country  And the crises is Donald Trump  but not only Donald Trump  I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump  Well  that is the floor  and not the ceiling  23 The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him  He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room  It's when we start focusing on each other  and understanding that our common bonds  and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before  It's what's gonna save us now  That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as President of the United States  Not just uniting the Democratic Party  but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God  And if you believe like I do  please go to corybooker com and join the mission  40 I don't think I disagree  I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation  you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from Labor  We have people that work full time jobs and still can't make a living wage  We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs  and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that's hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete   One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector  I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work  I'll tell you this  I live in a low income black and brown community  I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans  The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street's rankings is not helping people in my community  It is about time that we have economy that works for everybody  not just the wealthiest in our nation   Well again  I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that  When it comes to antitrust law  what I will do is number one  appoint judges that will enforce it  Number two  have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration  At the end of the day  we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing  We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they're trying to influence Washington  It's about time that we have a President that fights for the people in this country   We need to have someone that's a champion for them   I absolutely will  First of all  we're talking about this as a healthcare issue  but in communities like mine  low income communities  inaudible 00 24 11  an education issue  because kids who don't have health care are not going to succeed in school  It is an issue for jobs and employment because people that do not have good healthcare do not succeed at work  It's even a retirement issue  because in my community  African Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poor health care and so where I stand is very clear  healthcare is not just a human right  it should be an American right   I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All  but I have an urgency about this  When I am President of the United States  I'm not going to wait  We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care  On this debate  I'm sorry  there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America from pharmaceutical companies to insurers  Literally the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15  while Medicare's overhead is only at 2   We can do this better and every single day I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal     which is every American having healthcare   They should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible  This is one of The reasons why well before I was running for President  I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies  not take contributions from corporate PACs or pharma executives because they are part of this problem and this opioid addiction in our country  We  in cities like mine  have tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long  It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that   Yes   inaudible 00 02 43    On day one I will make sure that number one we end the ICE policies and the customs and border policies that are violating the human rights  When people come to this country  they do not leave their human rights at the border  Number two  I will make sure that we reinstate DACA  that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients  and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here  And then finally  we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle  not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem  We cannot surrender our values and then think that we're going to get border security  We actually will lose security and our values  We must fight for both   Jose   As my friend here said  I agree with him on that issue  But folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn't just go on at our border  It happens in our communities as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children  spouses in the light  and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work  We must end those policies   Well  this is a related and brief point  Because what we're talking about  what Secretary Castro and I are talking about  is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process  I have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups   Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things  whether it's immigration  whether it's mental illness  whether it's addiction  We know that this is not the way to deal with problems  There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem  Donald Trump isn't solving this problem  We've seen under his leadership a surge at our border  We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place  and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care  to affirm the values and human dignity the people that come here  Because we cannot sacrifice our values  our ideals as a nation for border security  We can have both by doing this the right way   May I address that  First and foremost  it was a mistake to pull out of that deal  And one of the reasons why we're seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation  Literally  he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10  20 years  And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled  being pulled in further and further into this crisis   We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal  but I'm not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I'm going to rejoin that deal  Because when I am president of the United States  I'm going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal  I'm going to do it   Well  first of all  I want to say my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail  But what's even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood  I think I'm the only  I hope I'm the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week  Someone I knew  Shahad Smith  was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year  For millions of Americans  this is not a policy issue  this is an urgency  And for those who have not been directly effected  they're tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading  writing  and arithmetic  and how to deal with an active shooter in their school   This is something that I'm tired of  And I'm tired of hearing people  All they have to offer is thoughts and prayers  In my faith  people say  Faith without works is dead   So we will find a way  But the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate  It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda  I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy  This is personal   I'm going to use 20 of my seconds just to say this  One thing we don't all agree with when it comes to guns  and I think it's common sense and over 70  of Americans agree with me  If you need a license to drive a car  you should need a license to buy and own a firearm  And not everybody in this field agrees with that  but in states like Connecticut that did that  they saw 40  drops in gun violence and 15  drops in suicides  We need to start having bold agendas on guns   When it comes to the Supreme Court  very clearly we  I agree with my friend  Secretary Castro  we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate  This is a team sport  Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina because we can elect Jaime Harrison  They need to campaign in places like Iowa because we can win a Senate seat there  This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we can not only balance the Supreme Court  but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isn't so aggressive because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party   You know  when I got to the United States Senate  going back to what De Blasio said  as an African American man in an African American dominated community  I knew one of the biggest issues was criminal justice reform  From police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850  And when I got to the Senate  people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done  As my colleagues in the Senate know  I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate  Bill coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the First Step Act  It's not as far as I want to go  but thousands of people will be liberated  I've taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and I've been able to get things accomplished   ut it's not enough  It's not enough  If I could add to this  It's very important   This is not enough  Look  Civil rights is someplace to begin  but in the African American civil rights community  another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African Americans  We do not talk enough about trans Americans  especially African American trans Americans and the incredibly high rates of murder right now  We don't talk enough about how many children  about 30  of LGBTQ kids who do no go to school because of fear  It's not enough just to be on the equality act  I'm an original co sponsor  We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in our country   Nuclear proliferation and climate change   Gracias  Fifty years ago  this month  my family moved into the town I grew up in  because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin  it was activists  mostly white activists that stood up and fought for them  That's the best of who we are as America  and why when I got out of law school  I moved into the inner city of Newark  to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people's rights  I've taken on bullies  and beat them  I've taken on tought fights  and we've won  And we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are  but rising to who's best   Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf  and his terms  We will beat him  I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again  This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him  but it's also a referendum on us  who we are  and who we must be to each other  It's time we win this election  And the way I'll govern is by showing the best of who we are  because that's what this country needs and deserves   
Beto O'Rourke,You know  I think about everyone who's ever served this country in uniform  We have two examples here on the stage tonight  Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard  Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our constitution  We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this President's criminality and his lawlessness  The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land  he invited the participation  the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy  As president  he lied to investigators  obstructed justice  fired James Comey  head of the F B I   tried to fire Mueller  head of the investigation  Then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics  as well as China in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal  53 If you do not hold them to account  if there is not justice  not only have we failed this moment  our constitution and our country  we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line and we cannot do that  11 I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati  in Lordstown  Ohio  which has just been devastated  decimated by GM and their malfeasance  paying effectively zero in taxes last year  The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there  what they want is a shot  They want fairness in how we treat workers in this country  which they are not receiving today  28 Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals  making sure that if we trade with Mexico  Mexican workers are allowed to join unions  which they are effectively unable to do today  Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker  it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage  If we compliment that with investment in world class pre K through 12 public education  get behind our world class public school educators  if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college  and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than five million apprenticeships over the next eight years  we will make sure that every single American has a shot  They don't want a handout  they don't want a job guarantee  They just want a shot  and as president  I will give them that shot  44 I think it's part of the solution  but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up  and sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other  instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions  I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas  Nevada  She's working four jobs  raising her child with disabilities  Any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already  Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations  35 She wants to know how we are going to help her  How we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs  that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities  that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage  Senator Warren said   Show me your budget  show me your tax plan  and you'll show me your values   She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase  Under my administration  if you make less than  250 000 a year as a family  you will not see a tax increase  That family needs to know that  30 There's no argument there  I just want to make sure that we're lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit  6  NAME  1 But in addition to that  will they see a tax increase  2 On this much  we agree  I just want to know if working families are going to get a tax increase  1 Yes  we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy  and being able to do it  thanks to Donald Trump  functionally  with impunity so far  so much so that they are invading this democracy right now  as we speak  still at the invitation of this President  So if there are not consequences  we will continue to see this problem going forward  25 But in addition   foreign language 01 25 23   to answer the previous question that you asked  how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage  We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships  That is what makes America stronger  There isn't enough money in this country  there aren't enough service members  as brave and courageous as they are  to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world  21 And the Kurds are case in point  In fact  because we turned our backs on them  those Kurds who fought for us in Syria  helped to defeat ISIS  not just for themselves  but for the United States of America  it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there  19 And then lastly  as General Mattis  who was invoked earlier  has said  we have two powers  one of intimidation and one of inspiration  We need to now focus on that latter power  and make sure that we invest in diplomacy in our State Department  and peacefully and non violently resolving our foreign policy goals  Not on the backs of 18  and 19  and 20 year olds anymore  But making sure that our diplomats are invested in  have the focus necessary by this next president to make sure that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world  30 Look  we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans  I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right  and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR 15s and AK 47s  Those are weapons of war  That they were designed to kill people effectively  efficiently on a battlefield  You mentioned the massacre in Dayton  nine people killed in under 40 seconds  In El Paso  Texas  22 were killed in under three minutes  And the list goes on throughout the country  31 So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell  then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR 15s and AK 47s out there  they're also too dangerous to own  Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror  Just ask Hispanics in Texas  Univision surveyed them  more than 80  feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants  inspired in part by this President's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso  38 So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law  the same way that we enforce any provision  any law that we have right now  We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law  I expect Republicans  Democrats  gun owners  non gun owners alike  14   to respect and follow the law  1 If someone does not turn in an AR 15 or an AK 47  one of these weapons of war  or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate  as we saw when we were at Kent State recently  then that weapon will be taken from them  If they persist  there will be other consequences from law enforcement  But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law  I believe in this country  I believe in my fellow Americans  I believe that they will do the right thing  26 This is not a purity test  This is a country that loses 40 000 of fellow Americans every year to gun violence  This is a crisis  and we've got to do something about it  And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I'm describing  I want to make sure we have universal background checks  and red flag laws  and that we end the sale of these weapons of war  But to use the analogy of healthcare  it would be as though we said   Look  we're for primary care  but let's not talk about mental healthcare because that's a bridge too far  People need that primary care now  so let's save that for another day   No  let's decide what we are going to believe in  what we are going to achieve  and then let's bring this country together in order to do that  Listening to my fellow Americans  to those moms who demand action  to those students who march for our lives  who in fact came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan  44   that calls for mandatory buybacks  Let's follow their inspiration and lead  and not be limited by the polls  and the consultants  and the focus groups  Let's do what's right  10   while we have time to do what's right  0 That's a mischaracterization  Anderson  I've got answered this  Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue  But when you  Mayor Buttigieg  described this policy as a shiny object  I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy  but to those who have survived gun violence  those who've lost a loved one to an AR 15  an AK 47  March For Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics  and poll tested politicians  That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups  and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR 15 and an AK 47  We must buy them back  40  crosstalk 00 01 36 15   2 Yes  it is  for many of the reasons that Mr  Yang just described  and also just from some personal experiences I've had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward  in some cases publicly  at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions  I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA  Now imagine that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana  because we made that legal in America  insured the VA could prescribe it  expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession  and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted  40 I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar  Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions  Purdue Pharma  Johnson   Johnson  we're going to continue to have this problem going on again  So  that veteran that I met  and anyone with drug addiction today  is not a problem for the criminal justice system  They're an opportunity for our public health system  crosstalk 01 49 50   18 Yeah  We need to set very tough  very clear transparent rules of the road  The kind of rules that we do not have today  That allow these social media platforms  where we the people have become the product  to abuse that public trust  To do so at extraordinary profits  Right now we treat them functionally as a utility  When in reality they're more akin to a publisher  They curate the content that we see  Our pictures and personal information that they share with others  We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing  To publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out  that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the Vice President  Treat them like the publisher that they are  That's what I will do as president  45 We will be unafraid to breakup big businesses if we have to do that  But I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up  That's something that Donald Trump has done  In part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power  It's not something that we should do  22 Tough rules of the road  protect your personal information  privacy and data  Be fearless in the face of these tech giants  7 There was some talk about getting big things done  When I was first elected to Congress I found that El Paso  Texas had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental healthcare provider at the VA  I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country  or even most people in El Paso  but it was important to those veterans who I served  We set about turning around the VA  Hiring up the psychiatrists  and psychologists  and therapists to take care of those women and men who'd put their lives on the line for this country  30 We were able to do that  We took what we learned and we applied it to a national law  As a member of the minority  working with Republicans and Democrats alike  to expand mental healthcare access for veterans nationally  13 Then in Texas  one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country  going to every single county  5   talking about this progressive agenda and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won  That's the way that we defeat Donald Trump in  6   November of 2020  0 I've always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges regardless of the differences  I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago  making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso  Texas  Did it as a member of the city council where I saw my colleagues  not as Republicans or Democrats  but my fellow EL Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community  As a member of Congress  I remember being in San Antonio  I was visiting the VA there March of 2017  I found that my flight had been snowed in Washington  D C  Happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress  Will Hurd and on a whim I said   Do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington   And he called my bluff  We got in that Chevy Impala last car on the lot  it was spring break  drove 1600 miles across the country  Live streamed the conversation  a Republican and a Democrat  finding out what we had in common  58 By the end of that trip  not only had we formed a friendship  but we had formed trust  We worked with each other on each other's bills  I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill  showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats can work together on an otherwise contentious issue  And then across Texas  I mentioned winning more votes than in any Democrat  We want independence and Republicans in record numbers as well  I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity  31 We will make the most of this moment that we have here together  3 It's an honor to be on this debate stage  It is wonderful to be back in Texas  in Houston  back here at TSU  On August 3rd in El Paso  Texas  two things became crystal clear for me  and I think produced a turning point for this country  The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is  The cost and the consequence of his presidency  Racism and violence that had long had been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso  Texas  Where 22 people were killed  dozens more grievously injured  by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place  Inspired to kill by our president  46 The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now  The bitterness  the pettiness  the smallness of the moment  the incentives to attack one another  and try to make differences without distinctions  Mountains out of molehills  We have to be bigger  We have to see clearly  We have to speak honestly  and we have to act decisively  That's what I want to do for you as President of the United States  Thank you  28 Yeah  Thank you  Listen  I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge  and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now  But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all or nothing gambit  forcing 10s of millions off of insurance that they like  that works for them  to force them onto Medicare  and others who want to  as the Vice President does  incrementally improve what we have  which will still leave many  maybe millions  uninsured and uncared for in a state like Texas where the largest provider of mental healthcare services is the county jail system  We've got to do better  In my proposal  Medicare for America  say everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare  Everyone who's insufficiently insured  cannot afford it  can move over to Medicare  and those like members of unions  who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families  are able to keep them  That is the best possible path forward  60 I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then  and I was talking about it long before then as well  Racism in America is endemic  it is foundational  We can mark the creation of this country not at the 4th of July 1776  but August 20th 1619  when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave build the greatness  the success  and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy  We have to be able to answer this challenge  and it is found in our education system where in Texas a five year old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended  or expelled  based on the color of their skin  50 In our healthcare system where there is a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color  or the fact that there's 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America  I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundations  But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House  and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country  29 That's all right  That sounds good  3 I am  If it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield  If the high impact  high velocity round when it hits your body  shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that  So that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers  When we see that being used against children and in Odessa  I met the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour  Because so many other people were shot by that AR15 in Odessa and Midland  there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time  Yes  We're going to take your AR15  your AK47  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore  51 And I want to say this  I'm listening to the people of this country  The day after I proposed doing that  I went to a gun show in Conway  Arkansas to meet with those who are selling AR15s and AK47s and those who are buying those weapons  And you might be surprised there was some common ground there  Folks who said   I would willingly give that up  cut it to pieces  I don't need this weapon to hunt  to defend myself  It is a weapon of war   So let's do the right thing but let's bring everyone in America into the conversation  Republicans  Democrats  gun owners and non gun owners alike  34 I do  and if you read the rest of that article in the Washington Post  I talked about harmonizing our entry exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada  I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstays but I think the larger question that we're trying to get at is how do we rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image  In the image of Houston  Texas  the most diverse city in the United States of America  In the image of El Paso  Texas  one of the safest cities in the United States of America  Safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants  safe because we are a city of immigrants   foreign language 00 25 12   45 I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way  never cage another child  Make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody  But also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job  That we have been part of deporting people hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone who pose no threat to this country  breaking up their families  Democrats have to get off the back foot  we have to lead on this issue because we know it is right  Legalize America  begin with those more than 1 million dreamers  Make them US citizens right now in this  their true home country  and extend that to their parents  their sisters and their brothers  and ensure that we have a legal  safe  orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here  55 Yes  we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends  because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it  We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050  that we are halfway there by 2030  that we mobilize  5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that  that we invest here in Houston  Texas with pre disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding  Given the fact that this town has seen three 500 year floods in just five years  you'd like to think you're good for 1 500 years  but you're not  They're coming faster  and larger  and more devastating than ever  46 We're also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology  as well as the high paying  high skill  high wage jobs that come along with that  And then we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide  Planting cover crops  keeping more land under conservation  using no till farming  regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil  That's the way that we're going to meet this challenge  and we're going to bring everyone into the solution  32 Thank you  George  Everything that I've learned about resilience  I've learned from my hometown of El Paso  Texas  In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the President of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more  we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that  The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country  We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous  We see them as foundational to our success  to our strength and to our security and to our safety  43 Yesterday  I was visiting with one of those victims  He's the head coach of the Fusion  This is a girl's soccer team of ten and 11 year old girls  His name is Luis  He was shot in the legs multiple times  He was shot in the side multiple times  He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital  but from his hospital bed  he's still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team  Memo  his co coach  is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital  Those two men  Jessica and Marcella  their wives  they exemplify resilience to me  36 When we end this scourge of gun violence in this country  when we finally confront the racism that exists in America  when we're defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions  it will be in large part  I think  thanks to the example that El Paso has set  17 Thank you  0 I'm running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need  This moment will define us forever and I believe that in this test  America will be redeemed  In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president  we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone  for the rule of law for everyone  26 And a democracy that serves everyone  Whatever our differences  we know that before we are anything else  we are Americans first  And we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential  We will meet these challenges here at home and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad  24 Successfully confronting endless war and climate change  At this moment of truth  let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone  by everyone and for everyone  16 The answer is no  The middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world class healthcare  I think we're being offered a false choice  Some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins  Others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance  I have a better path  Medicare for America  Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow  Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare  and those who have employer sponsored insurance   crosstalk 00 20 38  34 Jake  this is important  0 You have some  Governor Bullock  who said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option  You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people's choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions  I was listening to D  Taylor in Nevada  His members want to healthcare that they fought for   crosstalk 00 20 57  17 Every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need  As the examples that Senator Warren showed us  our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer sponsored insurance  21 When we listen to the American people and this is what they want us to do  they want everyone covered  but they want to be able to maintain choice and our plan does that  8 I do  Because in my administration  after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders  more than 9 million of our fellow Americans freed dreamers from any fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge and for profit detention in this country  and then assist those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2 000 mile journey  Then I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not  33 How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40 000 people in this country to gun violence  A number that no other country comes even close to  that we know what all the solutions are and yet nothing has changed  It is because in this country  money buys influence  access  and increasingly  outcomes  18 The Centers of Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place  As president  we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office  We will listen to people  not packs  People  not corporations  People  not special interests  19 Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete  There's a new battleground state  Texas  and it has 38 electoral college votes and the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties  No matter how red or rural  we did not write you off  No matter how blue or urban  we did not take you for granted  and we didn't trim our sales either  We had the courage of our convictions  talking about universal healthcare  comprehensive immigration reform  and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late  We brought everyone in  and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump in Texas  34 I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments  As a member of Congress  when I learned that the El Paso VA had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country  meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied  and was related to the suicide epidemic  we made it our priority and we turned around the VA in El Paso  We took that lesson nationally  and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans  and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing  Donald Trump  To show that  at the end of the day  we will put the American people first before party  before any other concern  40 I've listened to scientists on this  and they're very clear  We don't have more than 10 years to get this right  and we won't meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country  We've got to bring everyone in  The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week  they want the challenge  they want those jobs  they want to create the future for this country and the world  Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari  New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country  and those farmers in Iowa say   Pay me for the environmental services  the planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements   That's how we meet the challenge  We do it with everyone in this country  We bring everyone into the solution  42 We'll call his racism out for what it is  And also talk about its consequences  It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say   Send her back   About a member of Congress because she's a woman of color  because she's a Muslim American  It doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over  from every tradition of faith  It is also changing this country  Hate crimes are on the rise every single one of the last three years  On the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel  the mosque in Victoria  Texas was burned to the ground  So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election  But we must also ensure that we don't just tolerate or respect our differences  but we embrace them  That's what we've learned in El Paso  Texas  my hometown  one of the safest cities in the United States of America  Not despite  but because it's a city of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees  We will show that our diversity  67   Is our strength  in my administration  1 I want to acknowledge something that we're all touching on  which is the very foundation of this country  The wealth that we have built  the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet  was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force  The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country today  As president  I will sign into law and new Voting Rights Act  I will focus on education  address healthcare disparities  But I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee's reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we've waited too long in this country to have  38 The question was about tariffs  and they're a huge mistake  They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard  and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences  18 When have we ever gone to war  including a trade war  without allies and friends and partners  As president  we will hold China accountable  but we will bring our allies and friends like the European Union to bear and we'll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor  not just here in the United States  20   but in the  crosstalk 00 05 52   2 I support free two year college  Earn that associate's degree  realize your full potential  Debt free four year college  but unlike some of the other candidates on the stage  that's not just for tuition  That is room and books and board  the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country  18 And then for that school teacher who in many places like Texas is working a second or a third job  full forgiveness for outstanding student loan debt  forgiveness for that person willing to work at the VA and serve our former service members  And we do not do that at the expense of unions  We elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life  23 I would in my first term in office  Agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war already in its 18th year that will make it any better  We've satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place  and it's time to bring those service members back home from Afghanistan  but also from Iraq  also from Yemen and Somalia and Libya and Syria  24 There is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight  As president  I will end those wars and we will not start new wars  We will not send more US service members overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name  We can resolve  14   these challenges peacefully and diplomatically  2 We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been  Right now we have a President who uses fear to try to drive us further apart  To meet this challenge  we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone  20 My whole life I've been including people in the success of this country  Starting a business with high value  high wage  high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America  Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day  In Congress  being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country  26 Then in Texas this last year  traveling to every county not writing anybody off  not taking anyone for granted  At the end of the day  winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state  Winning independence for the first time in decades  and winning nearly half a million Republicans and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play  I can win them  That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021  Thank you  32 This economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn't  and it's going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does   foreign language 00 03 47  Right now we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes  That's how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest  a  2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality  A new democracy that is revived because we've returned power to the people  no packs  no gerrymandering  automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now   That's how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody   I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone  Tax capital     at the same rate that you tax ordinary income  Take that corporate tax rate up to 28      you would generate the revenues you need to pay for the programs we're talking about   My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care  In Laredo  Texas I met a young man  27 years old  told me that he'd been to a doctor once in his life and on that visit he was told he had diabetes  He was told he had glaucoma and he was told  untreated because he doesn't have health care  he'll be dead before the age of 40  Getting to guaranteed high quality universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal  The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider  the ability to see a mental healthcare provider    In Texas  the single provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today  Health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible  Our plan says if you're uninsured  we enroll you in Medicare  If you're insufficiently insured  you can't afford your premiums  we enroll you in Medicare  But if you're a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you     your family   you're able to keep it  We preserve choice by making sure   No  I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for   crosstalk 00 21 29   That's right so for those     for whom it's not working   crosstalk 00 21 41  they can choose Medicare  Right  For those not working  they can choose Medicare   For the  inaudible 00 21 43  workers in Nevada who I listened to  who negotiated for those plans  they're able to keep them   Tonight in this country  you have 2 3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars  It's the largest prison population on the face of the planet  Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes  including possession of marijuana  at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it  and yet  despite what Purdue Pharma has done  their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we're seeing throughout this country  they've been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences  not a single night in jail  Unless there's accountability and justice this crisis will continue  In my administration we will hold them to account  We will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those who've been victims of this malfeasance in this country  get them treatment and long term care    inaudible 00 06 16  We would not turn back Valeria and her father Oscar  We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws  We would not build walls  We would not put kids in cages  In fact  we would spare no  crosstalk 00 06 35  expense to reunite the families that have been separated already   crosstalk 00 06 40  And we would not criminally prosecute any family because who was fleeing violence and persecution  We would make sure we implemented   We would not detain any family fleeing violence  In fact  fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today  We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost  and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image  Free dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them US citizens here in this country  invest in solutions in Central America  work with regional stakeholders so there's no reason to make  crosstalk 00 07 20  that 2000 mile journey to this country   Let me respond to this very briefly   crosstalk 00 07 59  Actually as a member of Congress  I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don't criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country  If you're fleeing   If you're fleeing desperation  then I want to make sure  crosstalk 00 08 12  treated with respect   you're looking at just one small part of this  I'm talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws   And if you do that   crosstalk 00 08 22  I don't think it's asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country   If we apprehend a known smuggler or drug trafficker  we're going to make sure that they are deported and criminally prosecuted   Here's how we had that conversation in Texas  I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting  A young student named Bri  her friend Marcel who survived another shooting  the mother of a victim who lost her life  Rhonda Heart  They talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole  We know that they save lives  Talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities  Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible  They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities  Red flag laws  so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else  they're stopped before it's too late   And what I found in each one of those 254 counties  is that Democrats  and Independents  and Republicans  gun owners and non gun owners alike agreed  But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue  Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida and they've been able to change those laws  They're making our democracy work  ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass   I think you've got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face  That's why we're traveling everywhere  listening to everyone  We were in Pacific Junction  a town that had never meaningly flooded before  just up against the Missouri River in Iowa  and every home in that community had flooded  There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes  Those farms already underwater in debt  their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration  and now they don't know what to do   We  in our administration  are going to fund resiliency in those communities  in Miami  in Houston  Texas  those places that are on the front lines of climate change today  We're going to mobilize five trillion dollars in this economy over the next 10 years  We're going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels  And we're going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver's seat  Renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil  Paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide  If all of us does all that we can  then we're going to be able to keep this planet from warming another two degrees Celsius and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential   John  I appreciate the question  The answer is yes  but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends  When the United States presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer  the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda  the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward  But unfortunately  under this administration  President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances  He's diminished our standing in the world and he's made us weaker as a country  Less able to confront challenges  whether it's Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same  He's embraced strong men and dictators at the expense of the great democracies  As president  I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy  I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together  That makes America stronger   xistential threat is climate change  We have to confront it before it's too late   Yes  and I'll tell you why   ne of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States capital is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress at the height of his power submitting to the rule of law and the will of people  That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years   If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power  a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy  if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand  So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we followed them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy  And if we have not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences  there is accountability  and there is justice  Its the only way that we save this country   daughter Molly turned 11 this week  I'm on the stage for her  for children across this country  including some her same age who've been separated from their parents  and are sleeping on concrete floors  under aluminum blankets  tonight   If we're going to be there for them  if we're going to confront the challenges that we face  we can't return to the same old approach  We're going to need a new kind of politics  one directed by the urgency of the next generation  Those climate activists who are fighting not just for their future  but for everyone's  Those students  not marching for their lives  but for all of ours  We'll need a movement like the one that we led in Texas  It renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in  and writing nobody off  That's how we beat Donald Trump  and that's how we bring this great country together again   Join us  This is our moment  and the generations that follow us are counting on us to meet it   
Bill de Blasio,To the working people of America  tonight I bring you a message of hope  We can make change in this country  I know from personal experience it can be done  When I became the mayor of the nation's largest city  I set us on a path of bold change  They said it couldn't be done  but we gave pre K to every child for free  We got rid of Stop and Frisk and we lowered crime  We raise the minimum wage to  15 00 an hour  yes  it can be done  Now tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats  There are good people on this stage  but there are real differences  Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president  44 Kamala Harris said she's not trying to restructure society  Well  I am  For 40 years  working people have taken it on the chin in this country  For 40 years  the rich and gotten richer and they paid less and less in taxes  It cannot go on this way  When I am president  we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure it's a country that puts working people first  31 Thank you  I don't know what the Vice President or Senator are talking about  The folks I talked to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them  There's tens of millions of Americans who don't even have health insurance  tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays  the deductibles  the premiums  the out of pocket expenses  There's this mythology that somehow all these folks are in love with their insurance in America  What I hear from union members and from hardworking  middle class people is  they wish they had better insurance  30 From hard working middle class people is  they wish they had better insurance and they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental health care  dental care  9 The things that would be full coverage for all Americans  2 Yeah  I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fear mongering about universal healthcare  It makes no sense  Ask the American people  they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them  Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies  they feel it's holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need  They get a lot of nos  they don't get a lot of help from health insurance companies  Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold  That says   We don't need to be dependent on private insurance   We could have a system that actually covers everyone  30 You know what  Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo  How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo  9 For working people  1 Certainly  with all due respect to Senator Bennet  what he's saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes  Americans right now are paying so much money for their healthcare  ask people about the reality of premiums  deductibles  copays  out of pocket expenses  16 That's worse than any tax  1 And people are paying that right now  1 Senator  if we as Democrats say   We're done with private insurance  It has only hurt the American people in so many ways  We're going to give them something that works for their families  full coverage that they can depend on   If we say that  then there's an election  the American people get to decide  The ultimate choice  Senator  is an election  And this should be the party that stands for universal healthcare and says   We're not going to accept anything less  Right now in America  so many people don't have the healthcare they need  That is a fact  Tens of millions of people  including  31 Middle class people  0 Give them a chance to make that decision  1 Through an election  0 Two points  One  it's all kind of a charade because there's 11 million people here  and everyone in theory has broken the law  but they're part of our communities now  they're part of our economy  they're our neighbors  Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or a criminal penalty  when it's an American reality and what we need is comprehensive immigration reform once and for all to fix it  23 Second  Vice President Biden  I didn't hear your response when the issues came up of all those deportations  You were Vice President of the United States  I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power  your influence in the White House  Did you think it was a good idea  or did you think it was something that needed to be stopped  16 Yeah  I agree with the Congress member  but I don't hear an answer from the Vice President  I'm confused  I asked the Vice President point blank  did he use his power to stop those deportations  He went right around the question  Mr  Vice President  you want to be President of the United States  you need to be able to answer the tough questions  I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump  he's not going to let you off the hook  21 So did you say those deportations were a good idea  Or did you go to the President and say   This is a mistake  we shouldn't do it   Which one  7 I still don't hear an answer  1 Let me tell you  I know the Garner family  They've gone through extraordinary pain  They are waiting for justice  and they're going to get justice  There's finally going to be justice  I have confidence in that  in the next 30 days in New York  You know why  Because for the first time  we are not waiting on the federal justice department  which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the justice department was pursuing their prosecution  And years went by  and a lot of pain accrued  29 And in the meantime  what I'm working on is making sure  and I have for five years  there will never be another tragedy  they'll never be another Eric Garner because we're changing fundamentally how we police  9 But there's one last point I have to say about the Justice Department  The Vice President  for two and a half of those years  Mr  Vice President  tell us what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department  12   to act in the Garner case  1 We have a huge problem and it's decades old in New York  but here's what we've done about it  We've declared the eradication of all lead  literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and for all as the goal of our administration  and we're doing something about it  Lead poisoning has gone down 90  since 2005 and we're going to literally bring it down to zero  because we're going to go into every place  buildings  schools  public housing  and take out that lead  remediate that lead once and for all  and that needs to be done all over this country  Now  the federal government used to not take any responsibility for  35   country  Now  the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing  For decades they've been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility  That's part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with  But I'll tell you what you do when you're actually in charge of something  I'm in charge of the largest city in this nation  You do not accept the status quo  you fix it  And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe  and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all  And there should be a federal mandate to do the same for Flint  for Detroit  for every place in this country  It can be done  34 Yeah  And I would just want to ask this question of all the candidates  but particularly of Vice President Biden  President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2 0  He's got a new name for it  It's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA  It's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA  like it did to Michigan  And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA  So Vice President  I believe you're the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA  Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA  And that what you will believe in  which a lot of us hope for  is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again  not just multinational corporations  41 I consider that a victory  2 You know what  We believe in redemption  Joe  We believe in redemption in this party  5 Mr  Vice President  1 We still didn't talk about Iran  0 We didn't talk about Iran  0 Because we're on the march to war in Iran right now and we blew by it  3 I respect the rules  2 But we  0 Have to stop this  0   March to war in Iran  1 And the Democratic party has to stand up for it  1 I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment  But I want to caution my fellow Democrats  while we move in every way we can for impeachment  we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives  And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment  We need more talk about working people and their lives  For example  are we really ready  And I ask people on this stage this question  are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes  That's something every American wants to know about  That's something they want answers to right now  So yeah  move for impeachment  But don't forget to do the people's business and to stand up for working people  Because that's how we're actually going to beat Donald Trump  The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020  51 Thank you  For the last three years  we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other  black versus white  citizen versus immigrant  and why  So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else  We can't let them get away with it  If we're going to beat Donald Trump  this has to be a party that stands for something  22 This has to be the party of labor unions  This has to be the party of universal health care  This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy  And when we do that  Donald Trump  right on cue will call us socialists  Well  here's what I'll say to him   Donald  you're the real socialist  The problem is it's socialism for the rich   32 We here in this country  we don't have to take that anymore  We can fight back  If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy  then go to taxthehell com and join us so we can build a country that puts working people first  21 Well  we've been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages  by raising benefits  by putting money back in the hands of working people   15 minimum wage  paid sick days  Pre K for All  things that are making a huge difference in working people's lives  But let me tell you what we're hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle from the heart and soul of our party  I want to make it clear  this is supposed to be the party of working people   Yes  we're supposed to be for 70  tax rate on the wealthy  Yes  we're supposed to be for free college  free public college for our young people  We are supposed to break up big corporations when they're not serving our democracy  This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive  and in New York we've proven that we can do something very different   We can put money back in the hands of working people  and let me tell you  every time you talk about investing in people in their communities  you hear folks say   There's not enough money   What I say to them every single time is   There's plenty of money in this world  There's plenty of money in this country  It's just in the wrong hands   We Democrats have to fix that   Hey  wait  wait  wait  Congressman O'Rourke  Congressman O'Rourke  Private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans  When you talk about the copays  the deductibles  the premiums  the out of pocket expenses  it's not working   How can you defend the system that's not working   Congressman  You've got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people   crosstalk 00 21 43   Why are you defending private insurance  crosstalk 00 21 50    Jose  we have to change our discussion about immigration  crosstalk 00 04 56  in this county  Because look at the bottom line here  Those tragic  That tragic photo of those  that parent  that child  and I'm saying this as a father  every American should feel that in their heart and every American should say   That is not America  Those are not our values   But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system  Because we're not being honest about the division that's been fomented in this country  The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges   For all the American citizens out there who feel you're falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you  the immigrants didn't do that to you  The big corporations did that to you  The 1  did that to you  We need to be the party of working people  and that includes a party of immigrants  But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we're going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people we're all in this together  If we don't change that debate  that politics that's holding us back  we won't get all these reforms people are talking about   crosstalk 00 06 01  That's what we need to do is Democrats   crosstalk 00 00 06 03    Hey  but wait a minute  Neither Democrats nor Republicans  crosstalk 00 19 27   Have been serious about the war  crosstalk 00 19 32    Rachel  I am chief executive of the nation's largest city and I also want to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question  Look  I run the largest police force in America too and if we're going to stop these shootings  if we're going to get these guns off the street  we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community  I also want to say that something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race  and that is for the last 21 years I've been raising a black son in America  And I have had to have very very serious talks with my son Dante about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country  including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too  As we saw recently in Indiana   So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns  but also a different conversation about policing that brings police and community together  We've done that in New York City and we've driven down crime while we've done it   ut to your question about Mitch McConnell  there's a political solution that we have to come to grips with  If the democratic party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states  including red states  to convince people we're on their side  we could put pressure on their Senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward  decent  inaudible 00 18 56  deserve that right   What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation  with deep respect to the Congressman  Look  we've learned painful lessons as Americans that we've gone to war without congressional authorization  And look  this is very personal for me  I know the cost of war  My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the US Army  Battle of Okinawa  had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars  both physical and emotional  and he did not recover  He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life  And that battle didn't kill him  but that war did  And look  even in the humanitarian crisis  And I think we should be ready  Congressman  to intervene god forbid there is a genocide  but not without congressional approval  Democrats and Republicans  both in the Congress  have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval  We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten  The decisions have to be made by the United States Congress in the name of the people   Russia because they're trying to undermine our democracy and they've been doing a pretty damn good job of it and we need to stop them   It matters  It matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party  that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn't just talk about it  but gave people 15 dollar minimum wage  It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken healthcare system  and gave people universal healthcare  It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied Pre K  and gave it to every single one of them for free   These things really matter  And these are the things that I've done in New York  And I want to do the same for this whole country  because putting working people first  it matters  We need to be that party again  Let's work together  With your help  we can put working people first again  in America   
Michael Bennet,Thank you  Last week I saw one of those Trump signs that says  America  love it or leave it  and it was on the outside of the church  I love America and I know we can make it better  Before coming to the Senate  I ran a large urban school district where most of the kids live in poverty  Those kids have exactly the same hopes that I had  Their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me  And that Susan and I had for our three children  But for the last three years we've been consumed by a president who frankly doesn't give a damn about your kids or mine  Mr  President  kids belong in classrooms  not cages  And they deserve something better than a bully in the White House  Let's end this three ring circus in Washington and let's make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy  Empty promises won't beat Donald Trump  I can  86 I agree that it makes it much more likely  Unlike others on this stage  I've been crystal clear of where I've been for a decade  through two tough races in Colorado  I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family whether they want private insurance or public insurance  21 It requires drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare  and it provides competition  That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed  which would make illegal employer based health insurance in this country  and massively raise taxes on the middle class  to the tune of  30 trillion dollars  as Joe Biden said  We don't need to do that  It doesn't make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room  when we can pass a public option  Trust the American people to make the right decision and have universal healthcare in this country  in two years  Not 10 years  46 Senator Harris is my friend as well  but I have to say  if we can't admit tonight what's in the plan which is banning employer based insurance  we're not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing Democrats of doing that as well  We need to be honest about what's in this plan  It bans employer based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of  30 trillion dollars  Do you know how much that is  That is 70  of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years  We don't need to do that  35  crosstalk 00 30 23  We can have a public option and have  0  crosstalk 00 30 23  Universal healthcare in this country  0 This has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry  This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families  and they can choose a public option  Bernie Sanders who said last night he wrote the damn bill  and he did just like I wrote the damn public option bill  is the guy who says it'll cost  32 trillion dollars  and then we're going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it  He says that  Republicans don't say it  Don't try to distract from the truth  31 You can't hide from the truth here  2  crosstalk 00 35 05  We need to be for universal healthcare  2 I disagree that we should decriminalize our border  This is personal for me  my mom's an immigrant and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland  For those reasons  I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote  I wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with John McCain that passed the senate with 68 votes  That gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here  that would pass the most aggressive dream act that ha ever been conceived much less passed on the floor of the senate  and had 46 billion dollars of border security  38 Every single Democrat voted for that bill  3 And a lot of Republicans  That should be our position  5 That is our position  0 I think this is one in the end that we agree with  There's not a single person on this stage who if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border  14 That is what this administration has done in the American people's name  They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility  The symbol of this country before Donald Trump was president was the Statue of Liberty  That should be the symbol of the United States of America  not Donald Trump's terrible  crosstalk 00 42 12   19 Dana this goes to the last question you asked as well  which is how are we going to remain competitive  It's not just about trade  which we were talking about earlier  It's about whether we're going to invest in this country anymore  Since 2001 we have cut five trillion dollars worth of taxes  Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America  We have made the income inequality worse  not better  through the policies of the federal government  We've spent 5 6 trillion dollars in the Middle East  That's 12 or 13 trillion dollars that  from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan or anywhere else in America  we might as well just have lit that money on fire  We've got to stop doing that  And we need to invest in America again  For the money that we've spent  that I just described  we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country  We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed  We could have fixed  not just Flint  but every  64   Water system in this country  We could've made social security solvent for my children  5 But we did none of it because of self serving politicians in Washington DC who voted for deals that were good for them  7 But not for Michigan or the American people  1 I think  look  as we go forward here we need to recognize a very practical reality which is that we are four months away  We've got the August recess  then we are four months away from the Iowa caucuses  And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate  which it surely would  And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress  I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump  He has to be a single term president and we can't do anything that plays into his hands  We were talking earlier about climate up here  it's so important  Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that's ever in the White House  48 But we need to be smart about how  2   We're running or we're going to give him a second term  2 We can't do it  1 I don't disagree with that  you just said it better than I did  We have to walk and chew gum at the same time  It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that  And I'm glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition  13 That's what I was going to say  it's your brother that's giving you that good feeling about the congress  That's what we should do  6 Thank you  Thank you very much  What I want to say to all of you tonight is we have been here before as a country  We have faced challenges that we've actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought  how hard they work  how hard they organized the votes  they had to take the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic  more fair and more free  And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history  who doesn't believe in the rule of law  who doesn't believe in the independence of the judiciary  who doesn't believe that climate change is real  39 I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us  all of us  to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face  But the only way we're going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us  and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us  We need to come together united against a broken Washington  make Donald Trump a one term President  and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves  38 We have to do it for them  Please join me at michaelbennet com thanks for being here tonight  7 Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there  first  Second  that's why it is so important for us to win not just the presidency  to have somebody that can run in all 50 states  but to win the Senate as well  19 That's why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington  DC  I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying  I share a lot of her views  14 We need to end gerrymandering  We need to end political gerrymandering in Washington  The court today said they couldn't do anything about it  We need to overturn Citizens United  The court was the one that gave us Citizens United and the attack on voting rights in Shelby vs Holder is something we need to deal with  20 All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate  We face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition  It's the only way we can do it  We need to root out the corruption in Washington  expand people's right to get to the polls  and I think then we can succeed  19 Chuck  the problem with what the Vice President   1 No  The problem   0 Sometimes you do have to beat them but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the Tea Party  It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently  The Democratic party had been running against that for 10 years  We lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester  That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell  It was a terrible deal for America  33 Climate change and the lack of economic mobility Bernie talks about  4 Thank you very much  What an excellent question  First of all  we have to restore our democracy out home  The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership  We have a president who doesn't believe in the rule of law  he doesn't believe in freedom of the press  he doesn't believe in independent judiciary  He believes in the corruption that he's brought to Washington D C   and that is what we have to change  and that's why everybody is up here tonight  And I appreciate the fact that they're up here for that reason  28 Second  we've got to restore the relationships that he's destroyed with our allies  Not just in Europe  he flew to the G20 last night and attacked Japan  Germany  and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia  When you've got a situation where you have a president who says something happened in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn't know whether to believe it or not  that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America  35 And we need to change that  1 Our European allies and every Latin American country that's willing to have a conversation about how to deal with the refugee  inaudible 00 43 59   7 That's a good plan  1 Thank you  Thank you  My mom and her parents came to the United States to rebuilt their shattered lives in the only country that they could  300 years before that  my parent's family came searching religious freedom here  The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States  especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools  That's why I'm running for president  I've had two tough races in Colorado  but by bringing people people together  not by making empty promises  And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump  end the corruption in Washington  and build a new era of American democracy and American opportunity  47 This is going to be hard to do  but it's what our parent's would have expected  it's what our kids deserve  6 I hope you'll join me in this effort  Thank you  2 
Kirseten Gillibrand,So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office  The second thing I'm going to do  is I will reengage on global climate change  and I will not only sign the Paris global climate accords  but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis  22 The greatest threat to humanity is global climate change  I visited a family in Iowa who water spewed into her home  Fran Par  it tossed her refrigerator upend  all the furniture was broken  all the dishes were broken and mud was everywhere  That is the impact of severe weather right now on families lives  20 And so the truth is we need a robust solution  When John F  Kennedy said   I want to put a man on the moon in the next 10 years  not because it's easy  but because it's hard   He knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation  our success  our ability to galvanize worldwide competition  He wanted to have a space race with Russia  Why not have a green energy race with China  Why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans  Why not rebuild our infrastructure  Why not actually invest in the green jobs  That's what the Green New Deal is about  31 Not only will I pass it  but I will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us  4 
Marianne Williamson,Thank you  In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility  It was the idea that people  no matter who they were  would simply have the possibility of thriving  We have not ever totally actualized this ideal  but at the times when we have done best  we have tried  21 And when forces have opposed them  generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces  We did that with abolition and with women's suffrage and with civil rights and now it is time  a generation of Americans to rise up again  15 For an amoral economic system has turned short term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god and this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the wellbeing of we  the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live  Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem  We  the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility  Say no to what we don't want and yes to what we know can be true  36 I'm Marianne Williamson and that's why I'm running for president  3 I don't know if Senator Warren said that about me  specifically  I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said  but I have to say I have  I'm normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one  I hear the others and I have some concern about that as well  and I do have concern about what the Republicans would say and that's not just a Republican talking point  I do have concern that it will be difficult  I have concerns that it will make it harder to win and I have a concern that it will make it harder to govern because if that's our big fight  then the Republicans will so shut us down on everything else   crosstalk 00 27 26  34 Everything that we're talking about here tonight is what's wrong with American politics  And the Democratic Party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks not just about symptoms  but also about causes  When we're talking about healthcare  we need to talk about more than just the healthcare plan  We need to realize we have a sickness care rather than a healthcare system  We need to be the party talking about why so many of our chemical policies and our food policies and our agricultural policies and our environmental policies and even our economic policies are leading for people getting sick to begin with  28 That's what the Democratic  But I want to say more about immigration  3 Okay  0 I hope you'll come back to me this time  0 The issue of gun safety  of course  is that the NRA has us in a choke hold  But so do the pharmaceutical companies  so do the health insurance companies  so do the fossil fuel companies  and so do the defense contractors  And none of this will change until we either pass a Constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns  18 But for politicians  including my fellow candidates  who themselves have taken tens of thousands  in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars from these same corporate donors  to think that they now have the moral authority to say we're going to take them on  I don't think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada  yada  yada  It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of these corporations and can say with real moral authority   That is over  We are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns   That's what we need to stand up to  We need to have a Constitutional amendment  we need to have legislation to do it  37 And until we do it  it's just the same old  3 My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg  I was recently in Denmark  South Carolina where it is  There is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint  We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act  We have communities  particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities  all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice  I assure you  I lived in Grosse Pointe  What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe  This is part of the dark underbelly of American society  The racism  the bigotry  and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight  If you think any of this wonkiness is is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country  then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days  We need to say it like it is  It's bigger than Flint  It's all over this country  It's particularly people of color  It's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back  And if the Democrats don't start saying it then why would those people feel that they're there for us  And if those people don't feel it they won't vote for us and Donald Trump will win  64 Thank you  0 Senator Klobuchar  thank you very much  Congressman O'Rourke  please respond  4 Well  first of all  it's not 500 billion dollars in financial assistance  It's 500 billion dollar  200 to 500 billion dollars  payment of a debt that is owed  That is what reparations is  We need some deep truth telling when it comes  We don't need another commission to look at evidence  I appreciate what Congressman O'Rourke has said  It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal  All that a country is as a collection of people  People heal when there is some deep truth telling  We need to recognize that  when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America  it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with  That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism  48 What makes me qualified to say 200 to 500 billion dollars  I'll tell you what makes me qualified  If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule  given that there was four to five million slaves at the end of the civil war  four to five  and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four  If you did the math today  it would be trillions of dollars  And I believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult  And I believe that 200 to 500 billion is politically feasible today  because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface and emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal  41 I think that all domestic and international policies should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy  That's how you stimulate your economy  So if a few people take advantage but there are four or five people who are going to take the money that they then have in the bank  19 When you look at this  1 5 trillion college debt  this is why I agree with Bernie or I would be the  okay  why don't we swap it  We had a  2 trillion tax cut where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very  very richest among us  That does not stimulate the economy  15 If we get rid of this college debt  think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending  they'll be able to start their business  The best thing you could do to stimulate the US economy is to get rid of this debt  This is not just about a plan to do it  it's about a philosophy of governing  16 And I've heard some people hear tonight  I almost wonder why you're Democrats  You seem to think there's something wrong about using the instruments of government to help people  That is what government should do  All policy should help people thrive  That is how we will have peace and that is how we will help  crosstalk 00 10 19   17 Thank you  0 Yes  Our problem is not just that we need to defeat Donald Trump  We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred  collectivized hatred and White nationalism  In order to do that  we need more than political insight  or game  and wonkiness  and intellectual argument  Those things will not defeat Donald Trump  19 We need some radical truth telling  not just to talk about healthcare but talk about why we're so sick all the time  We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed  Even on the subject of foreign policy  it's all about symptoms and not about cars  We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership  the fact that countries see us not only domestically but internationally with policies that simply support our corporate overlords  26 The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace building  There's some corruption that's so deep  ladies and gentleman  Until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to deeper corruption knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated  then I'm afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home  29 I want a politics that goes much deeper  I want a politics that speaks to the heart  because the only way to fight   you keep talking about how we're going to fight Donald Trump  You can't fight dog whistles  you have to override them  The only way you can override them is with new voices  voices of energy that only come from the fact that America has been willing to live up to our own mistakes  atone for our own mistakes  make amends for our own mistakes  love each other  love our democracy  love future generations  something emotional and psychological that will not be emerging from anything on this stage  It will emerge from something I'm the one who's qualified to bring forth  39 Well  first of all  the government should never had made the deal with the big pharma that they couldn't negotiate  That was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us  You know  I wanted to say that while I'm with Senator Bennet and others  but I agree with almost everything here  I'll tell you one thing  it's really nice that we've got all these plans  but if you think we're going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans  you got another thing coming  Because he didn't win by saying he had a plan  He won by simply saying   Make America Great Again   29 We've got to get deeper than just these superficial fixes  as important as they are  Even if we're just talking about the superficial fixes  ladies and gentlemen  we don't have a healthcare system in the United States  We have a sickness care system in the United States  We just wait until somebody gets sick  and then we talk about who's going to pay for the treatment and how they're going to be treated  21 What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses  so many more compared to other countries  That gets back into not just the big pharma  not just health insurance companies  it has to do with chemical policies  it has to do with environmental  16 Policies  1 It has to do with food policies  It has to do with drug policies  0 It even has to do with the environmental policies  1 Deal with these children  2 I'm sorry  1 Yes  what Donald Trump has done to these children  and it's not just in Colorado  Governor  you're right  it is kidnapping  And it's extremely important for us to realize that  If you forcibly take a child from their parent's arms  you're kidnapping them  And if you take a lot of children  and you put them in a detainment center  thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them  that's called child abuse  This is called collective child abuse  And when this is crime  both of those things are a crime  and if your government does it  that doesn't make it less of a crime  These are state sponsored crimes  35 And what President Trump has done  is not only attack these children  not only demonize these immigrants  he is attacking a basic principle of America's moral core  We open our hearts to the stranger  This is extremely important  And it's also important for all of us  remember  And I have great respect for everyone who is on this stage  but we're going to talk about what to do about healthcare  Well  where have you been guys  because it's not just a matter of a plan  And I haven't heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American Foreign policy in Latin America  and how we might have in the last few decades  contributed to something being more helpful  37 No  0 I think it's important  0 All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics  There are symptoms  The underlying cause has to do with deep  deep  deep realms of racial injustice both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system  13 The Democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason  I do not believe that the average American is a racist but the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States  15 All of these things have to do  crosstalk 00 08 36   1 And the fact that somebody has a younger body doesn't mean you have old ideas   crosstalk 00 25 45  3 John Kennedy did not say   I have a plan to get a man to the moon  and we're going to do it  and I think we can all work together  and maybe we can get a man on the moon   John Kennedy said   By the end of this decade  we are going to put a man on the moon   because John Kennedy was back in the day when politics included the people and included imagination  and included great dreams  and included great plans  26 And I have had a career not making the political plans  but I have had a career harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people  9 Masses of people  when we know that when we say  2 We are going to turn from a dirty economy  2 To a clean economy  we're going to have a Green New Deal  we're going to create millions of jobs  we're going to do this within the next 12 years because I'm not interested in just winning the next election  We are interested  10 In our grandchildren  1 My first call is to Prime Minister of New Zealand  who said that her goal is to make New Zealand the place where it's the best place in the world for a child to grow up  I would tell her girlfriend  you are so on  because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up  15 Well  one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say   We're back   Because I totally understand  6   that the United States be part of the Western Alliance  5 I'm sorry we haven't talked more tonight about how we're going to beat Donald Trump  I have an idea about Donald Trump  Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk  He's not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans  He's going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea of what this man has done  This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he's harnessed fear for political purposes  So  Mr  President  if you're listening  I want you to hear me please  You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out  So  I  sir  I have a feeling you know what you're doing  I'm going to harness love for political purposes  I will meet you on that field and sir  love will win  41
