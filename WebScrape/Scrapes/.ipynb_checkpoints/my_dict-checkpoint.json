I ended up buying a 4'X4' high-quality 3/4\" sheet and cutting out a 27\"X40\" section that I bolted in. Then I added a hinged smaller section (11\" wide - I forget the length dimension offhand, but it's shorter in order to be able to clear the seatback and swing up). This allows access to (part of) one of the underseat storage areas.

I am going to use a heavy neoprene (I think, 1/4 inch plastic similar to plexi, but pliable) and make a folding \"platform\" that I can fold up and store under the seat, or behind. I have the neoprene already. I also used a heavy packing blanket (free) and put bungie cords where the headrests, front and back seat, attaches. This makes a hammock that will help keep dogs in back, hopefully. Since one of my dogs is 80+ pounds, keeping him lower wouldn't be much benefit. A saftey harness is a better way to prevent injury in a crash. I'll post pictures when done, but it may be awhile as not a top priority.\n\nI don't understand the \"scratching\" complaints, as my dog would not be in the truck without me.

My solution took considerably longer because I wanted to fill a few more inches of space in each dimension. I ended up buying a 4'X4' high-quality 3/4\" sheet and cutting out a 27\"X40\" section that I bolted in. Then I added a hinged smaller section (11\" wide - I forget the length dimension offhand, but it's shorter in order to be able to clear the seatback and swing up). This allows access to (part of) one of the underseat storage areas. This configuration took up just about all of the usable width inside of the rear doors (51\").\n\nDue to a lot of little issues, this took a lot longer than it should have, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Only slight regret is that I'd thought about finishing the plywood somehow for those times it gets wet. Instead I settled for attaching adhesive neoprene (which I already had) along some of the edges - I need to buy some more to finish it. I play to leave most of the platform covered with a foam mat as shown.\n\nThere is one problem with bolting in a pre-cut sheet and just being done with it: Although there is a mostly solid, plastic-covered metal frame around the front and back of the underseat area, the back middle of it (the crossmember) is slightly higher than everything else. So once I got the plywood fitted, I ended up sticking on small, thinner pieces of wood - shims, if you will - in several spots to make sure the sheet was level and had no noticeable curvature or \"give.\" So it's not just supported by the higher center piece and wobbly on either side of it.\n\nTips:\n\nThe seatbelt anchor bolts are M10 1.5 pitch. I purchased new ones with 50mm length since the original bolts were not long enough for the 3/4\" plywood.\nThe small holes behind the seatbelt bolt holes are for screws that protrude from the floor; I wanted them to be able to pass through the board.\nI also attached adhesive neoprene to all contact points, especially weight-bearing points, in the underseat storage/support area.\nI left the seatbelts attached behind the seat. It appeared it might be a challenge to remove at least the driver's side belt. Also, removing the wiring to the seatbelt sensors would have triggered a fault warning every time I start the truck. I found a Forscan fix for this that supposedly worked on a Ranger, but I decided it wasn't worth the experimentation. Maybe later.\nThe main reason I did this was for the dog (I want her as low in the vehicle as possible for safety and minimal distraction). But it will be much better for cargo capacity even when she's not there. I have absolutely no need for a rear seat 99.5% of the time.\n\nMaybe eventually a good solution will be developed to put a cover in place of the seatback as well, but for now I'm not concerned about it. Everything looks good and I'll probably cover the seatback with a sheet for protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\nIs it possible to delete the ENTIRE rear seat?

I removed them even before I changed the seats because I never use the rear seats for passengers (only my dogs) and it gives a better view out the rearview mirror with them out. They can easily be reinstalled, but you do have to punch holes in the seats, which is a fairly simple process. The reason there were no pre-cut holes is due to the leather being stretched over the existing seats, and the hole placement needs to be precise so it can be covered by the receiver sockets that go into the receivers sleeves on the seats. I do plan on putting the socket holders back in place for when they\u2019re needed, but will not be putting the headrests back in. The headrest covers do come as part of the kit.

The vinyl in the lariat is about as cheap and non-porous as you can get. I have always had leather seats since after my 65 Mustang. The vinyl on the backs of these leather seats I now have put the lariat to shame and is tuff to tell the difference from the leather on the fronts. Had the original Latiat seats been the same quality of what they use on the backs of these current leather seats that I now have, I wouldn\u2019t have changed them. BTW, leather only cracks if it\u2019s cheap and/or you don\u2019t condition it properly. I had a 1984 Porsche 928 with a leather dash in Southern California, and the leather was in perfect condition after 10 years.

So before you call me, a liar, maybe you better read a little more closely. And I do know all about which parts of the seats are leather and which parts are vinyl. (My 1984 Porsche 928 was 100% leather interior including the dash, doors and headliner and I never had a problem with cracking in the 10 years I owned it). What I know is with the seat covers that I ordered, the vinyl used on the sides and back is a much higher quality than your active X, which is smooth, hard and has zero grain on it and is more like commercial bus and subway seats. Great for long wear, but not comfort IMHO. Looks aside, the feel is of both the leather and the vinyl is 100% better. And I don\u2019t think after sitting on those lariat seats for multiple 500 mile trips they\u2019re anywhere near as comfortable or breathable as you make them out to be regardless of \u201cActive-X\u201d. So you go ahead and pay extra for them if you like, (especially since you\u2019re comparing it to \u201ctypical\u201d and likely \u201cbonded\u201d leather and not higher quality leather).

It's not as durable as Active X that Ford uses ( and many other companies now) I had quite a few leather interiors over the years..I know the problems. What is wrong with the Ford Activ X seat material? I think it looks good, does not crack and does not need maintenance. Regular leather requires special care and cleaning to keep it looking its best and to avoid cracking or tearing over time. Ford doesn't require a similar schedule for ActiveX, which can be cleaned with a standard leather cleaner when necessary. When stains occur, ActiveX holds up to a stronger type of cleaner and the material is more resistant to discoloration than regular leather.\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\n#1 Acrylic shower insert vs natural stone\n#2 Exotic hardwood floors vs vinyl planks\n#3 Natural grass vs artificial turf\n#4 Champagne vs Bud Light\n\nThe latter in all these examples may be considered better by some, but you get my drift.

I've seen other threads mention cutting the belt in order to remove it, but you don't have to. Here's what I did which should be 100% reversible. Everything should be able to be reinstalled if it's ever needed or when it's time to sell the vehicle.\n\n1. Remove the plastic cover on the rear wall that sits over the belt and reel mechanism. Even though you're going to be careful, at least one of the fasteners on its backside is gonna break.  \n\n2. Pull the belt to get most of it unwound from the reel's spool. Stop pulling when you see the thick-looking end of the belt sitting within the reel's spool. Use a clamp to hold the belt to the reel bracket so the reel doesn't pull it all back in when you let go of the belt. You can use masking tape, rubber bands, whatever you have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. On the end of that belt webbing is a sewn loop with a plastic rod inside of it. Get a small screwdriver to pry on the loop of webbing so you can get it out of the reel's center section a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. When you've pulled the loop on the end of the belt out of the reel's spool just a bit, push the screwdriver into one end of the loop to push out the plastic rod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Once the rod is out of the loop, flatten the loop of belt as much as you can and shove it back down into the slot in the spool. Use the small screwdriver to push it further in. You should then be able to pull the end of the belt completely out of the other side of the spool. Since there's a spring with tension on the reel, it's going to scare you as you pull out the belt as it spins up to wood chipper speeds looking for something to feed upon. Its anger will die down in a second or two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. You'll now have all the belt out of the end of the spool, but the loop on the end of the belt is still confined by the slot in the reel's bracket. At this point, remove the whole reel assembly from the bracket on the back of the bed which will require a pretty large Torx bit. You'll need a Phillips screwdriver to remove a small screw which holds a plastic guide to the reel's bracket. Once the plastic guide is free, you can pull the end of the belt through it and the metal slot in the reel bracket that it was mounted in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Yaay! Now we've got a lot of loose belt. This photo lets you see the sewn loop on the end of the belt better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the one bracket which holds the other end of the belt to the floor also attaches the rear driver's side passenger belt to the floor, we can't completely remove the loose belt unless you want to cut that bracket. Don't do that. Pull all that loose belt under the seat, fold it up all nice, and zip tie it. You can let it hang in the underseat cargo area, or you can zip-tie it anywhere else under the seat if you want it further out of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the now-orphan buckle, I just pushed it down into its seat opening so it's no longer visible (a bit beyond what's shown in the photo below). How do you know which is the right buckle? I took a guess that the center buckle was the one that didn't have wires running into it for detection of whether it was latched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the reel mechanism now removed, you'll be left staring at the large empty mounting bracket on the rear wall where the whole works was attached.

I chipped away at it over the past couple months. The seat bottoms took about an hour each and the backs took about 1 1/2 hours. Running the wiring from the seats to the fuses took 1/2 hour. The rest of the time was figuring out hour to tap into power and location of the switches. I hope these pictures are clear.\n\nthese 1st 2 pics show the beginning of the bottoms. There are plastic clips that fold on themselves under the front and sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt each of the indented seams on the seats, there are plastic channels held to the base by metal rings called hog rings.

The base of the seat is far too deep relative to the front edge. It\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to notice in your test drive. But when you drive for long periods of time, I would be surprised if you don\u2019t notice it.

What I do know is that I can now drive without it causing pain in my right leg (which was a first for me, ever). I think I\u2019m going to file a complaint with Ford about this, only so that they are aware. I surely can\u2019t be the only one that tells them this was a problem.

But, at least I can drive it now and not have the pain (that I\u2019ve never had before!). I had mentioned in another response below, that the upholsterer felt the seat was a terrible design.

I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and the front edge of the seat is so high and so firm that it raises knee up and cuts off my circulation. When I lower the seat it\u2019s so darn low that I feel like I\u2019m barely able to peek over the hood, but that\u2019s not the worst of it because when I lower it to a level where my knees not being cut off, I have to move the seat exceptionally forward to the point where I\u2019m smushed too close to the steering wheel so that I can reach the accelerator.. And then the brake pedal is way too close to me and my leg is exceptionally bent\u2026it\u2019s very uncomfortable to drive. And oddly, even when the seat is lowered, the front edge raises as you move the seat toward the pedals. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019ve had a Ford F150 doer crew lariat and I\u2019ve also had a Ford ranger; I never had this issue with either of my trucks. I\u2019m almost feeling like I need to cut out some of the foam in the front? That would look atrocious and I don\u2019t know if I could be successful in doing it, but I\u2019m about ready to take that drastic of a measure.\n\nThe back base of the seat is much too low; it needs to raised or at least be able to pivot upwards so that the front can pivot downward. I\u2019ve gotten under the seat and I noticed a couple of brackets on either side that attach the seat to the rails. Maybe if we could get our hands on smaller brackets in the front, that could lower the front? Using the aluminum blocks that someone else mentions here would only serve to lift the front higher. Even if you lifted the back, the front edge would lift even further upwards. We need to find a way to pivot the seat so that the front edge goes down further..\n\nMaybe see if i can find someone who has a CNC or plasma cutter to help me cut shorter replacement brackets because it\u2019s becoming a real problem for me, it\u2019s actually very painful and dangerous to drive with the seat like this. I thought about putting a cushion underneath the very back to raise the back up but that\u2019s such an insane fix for this issue and that\u2019s not really a good solution. There has to be a better way to take care of this issue. I can\u2019t believe that they made this mistake.

After I got it through both openings, I superglued the slits back together being careful not to superglue the cable to the tray, so it can move freely if you want.)\n- Made a wood piece to fit in the tray,\n- Superglued the lightning connector to the wood piece,\n- Used command strips to hold the wood piece to the tray and the tray to the console (for when I take the phone out).\n- Total cost was $13: $3 - Command Strips, $10 - cable, $0 - Super Glue & wood piece (already had them)\n\nThis also keeps me from getting a wireless gadget for $75 or more to do CarPlay without the cable.

Just not sure how the material will hold up to extreme heat though ", "\n\nSembazuru said:\n\n\n\nOut of curiosity, how well do the so-called frost shields (for example this one from CoverKing) work as a sun shield in the summer? My thought is if it also works as a sun shield, one product for both seasons. Most of the ones that I've seen aren't reflective, but is that really necessary if the light blocking is outside the vehicle?\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\nIt's going to help some, but not nearly as much as a sun shade. A dark, opaque cover like the frost shield shown is going to keep some light and heat from entering the vehicle, but it's actually going to get hot and stay hot against the glass, as opposed to a light colored material that reflects more light. A sun shade takes this a step further with generally some sort of foil material or similar to really help reflect the sun light and heat away from the vehicle.", "I still feel like not enough people realize these umbrella style sun shades are so convenient. Yes they are cheap. Yes they will probably break if you breathe on them wrong. But you can find some for like $10 to $12 or less. You can put them under a seat, in the glove box, etc. I feel like setting up a sunshade (for me personally) in a vehicle is all about quantity (basic coverage) and convenience, not quality and perfection (i.e. perfect fit).\n\nI also bought this full size roll-up one but now I've thrown the roll-up in the garage attic since I use the umbrella style.

Sometimes being able to quickly switch to airplane mode on the phone just by swiping down helps solve the endless connection issues during music playback.\n\nI only use AA because my '22 does not have NAV and the FORD maps kinda suck either way.

You might as well just throw a universal plastic mat down for the same quality coverage. \n\nBut the TuxMats? By far the best coverage and material. The clips help keep everything in place and they are washable the same way any other floor liner is. I use a medium bristle brush, spritz some water on them, then spray 303 and scrub away. Simply wipe them down with a dry microfiber towel and they look good as new.\n\nI was skeptical about them at first mostly because the name brands everyone chooses are the HuskyLiners or the Weathertech ones - or similar cheaper knockoffs on Amazon (SmartLiner) - but I am so glad I got them in the Subaru Crosstrek I had.

I couldn't drive it longer than about 30 minutes before I got very uncomfortable. It cut into the back of my thigh, pinched at the hips were the bolster ended, and it was angled too far up in the front. I tried several solutions including different cushions and jacking up the back. Raising the rear up did the best and was a good temporary solution but I wanted the seat to be installed the way it came from the factory. I'm sure adding washers and the proper length bolts were fine but it still wasn't as good long term because the bolster still pinched and I removed the washers before my appointment. Also, the back of the seat cushion, closer to the seat back, was starting to allow the feeling of the wires in the seat to be noticed just placing my hand on the seat cover.\nI took the truck to an auto upholsterer and described my problem. They added foam to the back of the seat, closer to the seat back, to make it a little thicker and \"flatten\" the harsh tilt. They also shaved off some of the side bolsters, about the front 3\", and shaved a little under the thighs. That allowed the seat to feel a little longer under the upper leg.\nAll in all, I am much more comfortable. The seat feels bigger, flatter, and padded.

So I used to work in the cellular world so I have plenty of old phone holders laying around from the past. On this hack I decided to use my old Motorola mount from the Nextel days. I love this mount because it adjusts to every possible angle. Yes I have to have a button installed on the back of my phone. So I used 2\" hard insulation foam left over from a house project. I cut it to fit the shape of the cubby but just a hair bigger. I sanded it down to make it look somewhat presentable then painted it black so it would disappear. I also keep spare metal around for garage projects so to dress up the front of the mount and give it more strength I got the grinder out with a cutting wheel and cut a face plate for the foam. I then marked the holes for the Motorola mount and drilled them out......then filed the face plate smooth. I used very long 4\" screws to adhere the mount to the foam so it couldn't vibrate out in time. If it ever does vibrate loose I will just use long thin bolts, nuts, and washers. All that was left to do is push the foam into the cubby as to where it would stick out just a little so my phone would clear the knob below it. Given this is just rigid foam it can be tweaked however you like. Once you realize this whole foam thing is kind of stupid then you can go on line and pay $40 for the nice plastic cubby mount. I was going to use a pool noodle but I realized pool noodles dont hold screws very well.

Some have replaced their mirrors with one off a KIA if I remember right which was on clearance. Maybe the stinger on those were longer and would fit.

Only the back portion of the seat lowers when you lower the seat, so your distance from knee to the pedals remains the same. It just puts you in slightly more of a \"recumbent\" position, which is actually pretty ergonomic. You may need to lean the seat back just a bit, and move the steering wheel a bit closer to get everything situated correctly. You'll find your eye-level is now lowered - probably enough to make the mirror \"cluster\" a non-issue for you.\n\nYou might consider giving that a try before attempting a \"fix\" that could be challenging. I've driven mine adjusted this way for almost 4500 miles, including 20+ hours of highway trips where I was sitting for 3+ hours at a stretch. and LOTS of in-town driving with traffic lights, overhead signs, etc.. Zero issues, no complaints.

The first thing I do on rental cars is push the rearview mirror up as far as it will go. The Mav is drivable, but I'd rather it be higher. I have never on-purpose sat in a car with the seat in anything other than the lowest position, but I feel like it's okay if others have a different preference.", "Of course it is perfectly OK for each person to pick the seating position they most prefer! That's self-evident. \n\nBut just as some never realized that mirror could be adjusted up/down on those ball joints, others never realized that the seats do NOT actually raise and lower, but instead basically \"hinge\" at the front, with only the rear part raising and lowering.

In my vehicle now they get mixed up with whatever junk gets in to the tray. \n\nI think it would be a good fit for a raspberry pi with a 3.5\" screen mounted horizontal, with a 3d printed edge or bezel or frame to hold it. It should be possible to run a usb cable for power through the dash and attach it to the usb slots below somehow. \n\nThe thing is, I can't figure out what it would be for. With android auto it already has gps maps and streaming music, and all the real computer stuff for the actual truck are on the center display and there wouldn't be good sensors for that input anyway. You could blue tooth a controller and the passenger could play NES games or something on a tiny screen. I can't come up with a good purpose for it. Maybe music visualizations or something. Raspberry pi 3 and 4 have built in blue tooth so maybe it could connect to synch, but again I don't see much purpose in it.\n\nI'm thinking a size like this. It would be touch screen so might work for your buttons. This is 2.5\" X 3.5\" X 1.5\" deep. I think a 4\" screen would probably be too big for the slot.\n\nAnother thought, I have a little cell phone called a unihertz atom. It is about 3.8\" tall by 1.8\" wide. If I could find a way to run a usb power cable, maybe I could print some kind of bezel or frame and put it in there permanently connected to android auto or something. I like having it as a hiking gps though so I don't know. That has a 2.5 inch screen so would lose a lot to a raspberry pi.\n\nYou an install android on a raspberry pi and google play store. I don't know if one will run android auto. Maybe install android on a raspberry pi and connect to android auto through bluetooth, get the hotspot on the truck and connect raspberry pi to it with wifi. Sort of like having a permanent phone in there I guess.\n\nThere is a project to do sort of the opposite, to use a pi4 and display as the head unit in the car to run android auto from your phone, that doesn't really help here because we already have android auto in the mav.\nhttps://getcrankshaft.com/", "I was thinking of repurposing an older smaller phone that may fit in that cubby, and run DashCommand:\n\n\n\n", "2022 Lariat First Edition/Rapid Red/Hybrid - Delivered Jan 24, 2022\n2023 Lariat Tremor w/ Appearance, Atlas Blue - Delivered May 22, 2023", "Also the pocket terminator looks about the right size but it is not visually appealing https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/989790998/vintage-rare-pocket-terminator-sound\n\nSomething like this could display pictures, etc. \nhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-det...3.html?spm=a2700.wholesale.0.0.267dc097vo1lTw", "Another silly idea (maybe not?): You know how the Bronco has the accessory switches above the windshield, and the Hero switches on the dash above the screen?

In order to meet their requirement, I had to get my license. Since then, I started getting involved in some local events where I use them and go off-roading with two groups that use HAM exclusively, and a friend is also an amateur race car driver and the track insists we use a HAM frequency as well. Plus, I like being able to talk to friends who hate 'new fangled tech' both young and old (My own god-daughter despises cell phones and social media and she carries a ham radio instead).", "2022 Lariat First Edition/Rapid Red/Hybrid - Delivered Jan 24, 2022\n2023 Lariat Tremor w/ Appearance, Atlas Blue - Delivered May 22, 2023"], "https://www.mavericktruckclub.com/forum/threads/seat-covers-for-the-2023-xlt-maverick.26412/": ["From what I understand, all of the seats in all of the 22 and 23 Mavericks are the same size, although I could be wrong.

Then when I decided to change locations, I had a hard time figuring out which color the roof is. Seems Escapes are more of a light tan, where the Maverick is a light gray.

After doing a little digging I found where someone had swapped a Vivid Racing wheel into a 22' XLT (u/mice2mars on reddit) along with various other brands offering aftermarket wheels. I even saw one from user Vtec87pr1 on here who swapped a Mk8 Fiesta wheel onto his XL. However I found this to be a Fiesta ST-Line wheel and not a true ST wheel.\n\nI searched eBay (the evilBay for you VGG fans) for my options. Which were limited at best. A) OEM Escape/Bronco Sport leather wheel, which just didn't do it for me, thus the reason I kept my stock wheel when I did the ForScan cruise control mod. B) Aftermarket custom made wheel for the Mk8 Fiesta/Puma ST for about $600 which was too much money and too long of a wait. So that left me with option C). Importing a Mk8 Fiesta ST flat bottom wheel from Jastrzebie Zdr\u00f3j, Poland. All said and done it took 12 days to ship it to my doorstep for a grand total of $374.48. Which for the shipping distance and the product; it was a fantastic deal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you plan to do this swap yourself, please note that you will need to swap the OEM harness from the OEM Maverick wheel into the Mk8 Fiesta ST wheel. The European harness is incompatible with USDM airbag and horn connector. Additionally the Euro cruise control and multifunction switch will not work on the Maverick. It must be transferred with the OEM wheel. \n(Torque wheel to 35ftlbs per workshop manual)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDM harness (Left) vs Euro harness (right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDM switch (Left) vs Euro switch (right) held in with x4 T7's\n\n\nBefore and After!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b\nIt truly transformed the look and feel of the interior and I highly recommend it for anyone considering the swap.

Airbags can also deploy with enough force to kill a dog if they are positioned incorrectly outside of a crate, as they are specially designed for human range of motion under standardized seatbelts and not dogs. Confined in a transport carrier, you minimize the secondary impact forces, for the same reason we essentially strap down passengers.\n\nInside a crate, it really doesn't matter that much where the crate is located, as long as the crate is properly secured. If the dog isn't very small, you can more easily and securely strap down a larger crate in the bed than you can the interior, due to stronger and easily accessible anchor points.

Like they are just way too hard. My wife has a Kia Telluride and I have a Hyundai Elantra and the seats are way more comfortable. I tested the Hyundai Santa Cruz and it's also very comfortable. I'm seriously leaning on going with the Santa Cruz even though I don't really like the exterior looks of it as well and the cost is more. But comfort is important. My XLT black appearance package with co-pilot 360 is $30k. And I won't have to spend extra money to make it any better (besides tinting). For the Santa Cruz, it's more expensive already and I'd have to try some things to make it look a little better like better wheels/beefier tires, lift, fender flares. So it's tough for me to want to do that.\n\nWith all that said, has anyone put on some seat covers that have a little bit of extra padding and it actually helped?

I've only used FDM printers that take the spools of plastic and melt it through a nozzle to extrude it. Different plastic types just require different settings like nozzle temperature, print bed temperature, print speed, etc. Once you find out what works for the printer you have its pretty repeatable. \n\nThe liquid resin printers I'm not too familiar with but it seems a lot messier but the trade off is they print much faster.

I have the Mabett seat covers that I love already, so I knew they at least did some quality work. They put out some floor mats with a truck bed mat combo and I figured why not? I am loving these mats. Feel and look high quality to me and they fit perfect. Definitely recommend. \n\nThe bed mat is the same solid quality and honestly, it works fine. The only issue is that I have a drop in bed liner, so the mat goes up against the liner edges just a tiny bit. You can see it in the pictures. I\u2019ve seen other pictures of a bed without any liner or spray in and fits perfectly. The annoying drop in liner that doesn\u2019t fit flush against the truck makes this mat stick out just a little. But again, it fits more than well enough for me and I\u2019m happy with it. Figured I\u2019d share for those looking for any sort of mats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "I also got the same set and posted my review on the Mabett thread. I compared it to my existing rubber mats, and I wasn't as impressed. I'll copy and paste my review from there here.\n\nI purchased the hybrid floor mat and bed mat combo using the discounted links for $160+tax , but I have no affiliation with Mabett. They looked good and the price was reasonable. I also had a set of some generic Maverick hybrid specific rubber mats I got from Amazon before these so I'll compare the two. Here are some pictures to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the driver's side offers very good protection all the way up the dead pedal while the generic one stops ~2/3 of the way up. The side protection is slightly better on the generic one. On the passenger side, they're both pretty much the same.\n\n\nOnto what I think of them. It's immediately obvious holding the Mabett mats that they're significantly lighter and thinner. They're also a lot more slippery and more flexible. It's like smoother plastic vs the rubber texture of the generic ones. The material is pretty thin in comparison and out of the box the mats I had were already dented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese dents don't exactly pop out either. They go back to their dented form after I pushed it out. You can see some of them in the first few pictures. It's no comparison that the material here feels less durable than the rubber, generic mats.\n\n\nI also had some trouble with the clips that goes into the holes of the mats. I think the holes on the mats are a little too far back causing the mats to sit a bit forward. They don't touch the back edge of the raised floor where the seat rails are. On my generic mats, that wasn't the case. Minor complaint and not a big deal but something to note.\n\n\nLastly, when the mats are clipped in there just seems to be a bit of elasticity to them. What I mean is that if I drag my feet on these, the mats move a bit more than I was accustom to. It doesn't hold onto the carpet underneath as well as the rubber ones so they shift with some movement.\n\n\nHere's the bed mat if anyone wants a pic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBed mat fits well. I have nothing else to compare it to but it is the same material as the floor mats so I question the durability vs some thicker rubber-like ones.\n\n\nOverall, I'm not sure I'd be keeping these mats. I like the look of them and the coverage is great on the driver's side. I'm just not a fan of how thin and less grippy they are. Out of the box, they were already deformed in certain spots so I hope they don't crease or fold easily from everyday use. I hope someone finds this useful.\n\nBonus side by side comparison pics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "These look interesting glad the OP is enjoying them.

I don\u2019t believe my seat was damaged as much as it\u2019s just the way it was designed.

No Richard Simmons by any means but out of the 12+ vehicles I\u2019ve owned, this is the only one that\u2019s had an uncomfortable seat.\nI would lessen the cushion if I didn\u2019t feel the frame in it more.", "\n\nLM42 said:\n\n\n\nThe chances of another OEM seat part being a direct swap are going to be near zero.

However, one would need to compare the dimensions and wiring to be sure, and take extra effort to ensure airbag compatibility.\n\nEscape does offer a 10-way power driver seat which provides both tilt and height adjustment of the seat base.", "This reminds me of the early days of the Chevy Bolt. Half the buyers thought it was the worst seat ever made by man. The other half said the seat was fine and there was something wrong with the complainers. Then it devolved into an insult war. If you disagree with my seat opinion, then obviously you are [insert insult here]. There was an incredible amount of obnoxious behavior on those threads.\n\nErgonomics is hard because of the wide variety of shapes and sizes and ailments that we come in. Worse still, in the world of car manufacturing, ergonomics always meets accounting. And in the Maverick price range you get the seat approved by the accountant, with the seat designer doing what they can for that price point. One of the things you find at the Maverick price point (aka the cheap side) is that the adjustments are not up and down and fore and aft, but rather a mix of the two. You also lose things I have on my awesome Volvo, like pull out thigh bolsters and more.\n\nIf you have the money (lots of it), and if you really care about seat comfort, I'd recommend an aftermarket Recaro. They're infinitely adjustable. They're also expensive, but you can take your Recaro with you from car to car, courtesy of their mounting adaptors. I speak from experience, as I added Recaros to my RX7 R1 back in the day. If you don't have the money, there's nothing wrong with trying out seat covers and pads until you find one that works for you. Remember to look for the products that claim to improve back pain.\n\nAlso remember that you have an adjustable steering wheel. You'd be surprised how many of my friends have complained about seats until I point out that they can adjust the steering wheel up and down and in and out. And suddenly they find the seats are comfy.\n\nSee Sandy Munro's website - especially the video by Carl on seats. He actually knows what he's talking about. Just search their videos for \"seat\". Carl will explain how seats work, how material choices are made, and the various amenities.\n\nPersonally, I find my Maverick's seats OK (lux package with heated power seats).

I had multiple people request that I share how I installed mine in detail (for anyone interested in the process or for anyone interested in following this process step by step.)\n\n(Steps 1 & 3 & 4 will be fully shown in the linked YouTube video in Step 3)\n\nStep #1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the airbag- Turn the wheel left or right 90\u00b0 to expose the release clips on the backside of the steering wheel. Push downward with a flathead screwdriver that's long enough to reach the release clips, but short enough that it does not make contact with your gauge cluster and damage it. Turn the wheel 180\u00b0 in the opposite direction and repeat. The airbag should come out with three connectors on it. If you follow the workshop manual from Ford, there is a SRS depowering procedure, but nobody goes through it.\n\nDo what you feel comfortable doing.\n\nLift up on the orange SRS tabs with a small flathead screwdriver/techdriver or an angled pick. Once both tabs are lifted the connectors should wiggle out. If not, you need to lift the orange tab higher up. There should be one 2-wire white connector left at the top of the airbag for the horn. This disconnects like a regular connector. The airbag should be free. Sit it down on a soft surface. The final connector is a black rectangular one on the clock spring. Its at the top of the wheel as you can see in the picture. This is the main connector for the steering wheel switches and horn. This disconnects like a regular connector. \n\n\nStep #2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the steering wheel- Center the wheel and level it flat. This is for wheel and clock-spring alignment. I used a \u215c air stubby impact for this, but I\u2019m sure any electric impact will zip it right out. If you\u2019re doing this manually, you may need some helping hands to keep the wheel straight. The steering wheel bolt is a 24mm torqued down to 35ftlbs per the workshop manual. It doesn't take much to remove it. Once the bolt is removed, all you need to do is carefully pull towards you and the steering wheel will slide off. Make sure to gently guide the SRS wires though the wheel passthrough as the wheel comes off. They stay with the clock spring. \n\nFrom here the workshop manual suggests to tape the clock spring in place with painters tape. It cannot  be rotated around without the steering wheel installed, and if it does rotate, damage could occur. Tape prevents unintentional movement. Professional preference for me, I opted to jam a small flat head between the clock spring post, the clock spring itself, and column. Congratulations! You\u2019ve removed a Ford steering wheel! \n\n\nStep #3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly and transferring parts- Anyone who's done the cruise control mod with ForScan, already knows how to remove the plastics on the wheel. I will link a video below as it's easier to watch than to explain. Please be careful, you can break either steering wheel if you remove the plastics incorrectly. Start with your OEM Maverick wheel to \u2018practice\u2019 with. You won\u2019t need it once the swap is completed, obviously, so breaking something won't matter. Remove this on both steering wheels. Ensure to remove the connectors for the steering wheel buttons on both sides. \n\nFord Maverick Cruise Control 4:50 to 6:42 relevant for Steps 1 & 3 (video does NOT include wheel removal for step 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the plastic trim is removed, as partially instructed in the video, swap your factory Maverick steering wheel buttons over to your Fiesta ST plastic trim panel. Both Euro and USDM wheels use two T7 Torx bits per steering wheel control. There are two small tabs on the outside of each button as well, that just need slightly pulled outward to allow the buttons to release. The Euro switches that will come with your ST wheel are incompatible with the USDM Maverick. (USDM on the left vs Euro on the right in above picture) With that said, the Euro steering wheel harness is also incompatible with the Mavericks airbag. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is simple, just carefully remove both wiring harnesses from each wheel. Pay attention to how they were routed and their orientation. Take a picture if need-be. They are only held in with friction and grooves. Put the USDM Maverick harness into the Fiesta ST wheel. You may need a blunt plastic trim tool or similar to help seat the harness correctly. (USDM on the left vs Euro on the right in above picture)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep #4:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinstallation- Once you\u2019ve successfully rerouted your USDM wheel harness into the ST wheel, it's time to reassemble. This is shown in the aforementioned YouTube video at 6:42 to 6:50. Carefully and correctly push all the tabs back in place and reconnect your steering wheel buttons to the harness. This may take an attempt or two if you\u2019ve never done this before. Once properly seated and reconnected, bring your steering wheel back into the truck along with your 24mm bolt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuide the SRS wires through the wheel and remove the tape (or flathead) holding the clock spring in place. Seat the wheel correctly and firmly in place. Run the 24mm bolt down by hand until its finger tight. Reconnect the black rectangular connector for the horn and switches to the clock spring. Per the workshop manual, the wheel is to be torqued to 35ftlbs. I chose to set my torque wrench to 40ftlbs because I added an extension to clear the steering wheel.\n\nDo what you feel comfortable doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was able to torque this by myself but an extra set of hands never hurt. Once the new steering wheel is torqued down, it's time to reinstall the airbag. Connect the horn connector at the top of the airbag. Using the small screwdriver; seat the SRS airbag connectors flush with the inflator. The connectors are color coded. Push the orange tab down so the connector and tab seat flush as they were before removal. Then simply align the airbag in its hole, and push on the left and right side simultaneously. The release clips should engage, and the horn should honk. Congratulations! You\u2019ve installed a Fiesta ST steering wheel! \n\nIf you\u2019re an XL owner who is doing a wheel swap alongside the cruise control mod, please resume instructions on programming using ForScan to enable your switches. If that does not apply to you, ensure the SRS light goes off when you start the truck, and ensure all of your buttons work. If they do not, you forgot and/or didn\u2019t correctly seat a connector. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully this was helpful to those attempting to do this swap!

I plan on installing wireless charging using Chris Dunning's video. Like Chris, I plan on using Fuse #3 to power the charger. \n\nI love the wireless Android Auto. The MA1 dongle is awesome, but I want to hide it utilizing the same method TrippMe has posted in the forum previously. This will potentially leave me with a dead USB A port, so my first question is this: Can I re-wire that USB port for power only by tapping the fuse box (Similar to the MA1)? My electrical experience is limited.\n\nI will also be installing ambient lighting in all 4 footwells, the front center console and hopefully the cupholders using a modified kit. I'd like to install something similar to this for center console lighting: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AFU4QF4/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=A6XWG1D8Q4A4V&psc=1 To be honest, I will need to make sure the light has more of a flood effect than a narrow cone, but I don't want to mount an entire strip of LED's.\n\nAnyway, I plan on using this thread to document and post pictures as I work on and complete the mods. Everything I needed for the wireless charging installation was delivered yesterday, so I'm hoping I'll be able to post pictures of completion this weekend. I appreciate all the work and conversations you've all had that allow me to research everything, and I'm hoping I can bounce some ideas off of you before or during the process(es).", "I finally got started on the wireless charger. First, I needed to make sure the charger wouldn't have any problem with varying thicknesses of material and inserts in the center console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter double and triple checking the fuse, amperage and tap orientation, away we went. The first issue came up shortly after opening the package to the adapter. I knew immediately the red wire was not going to be long enough. The only wire I had was white 18 ga. It had to be red, so down to the big box store I went.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came back and took off the fuse cover and passenger side console cover. This part was easy and painless. I started assembling the fuse tap and noticed the light yellow fuses were 20A fuses....not 7.5 like I had expected, so back to the store I went. Hopefully done with the driving, I re-checked the fuses and tap orientation and installed them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I felt like I was making progress. I hooked up the battery and checked for power. Power was confirmed, so I disconnected the battery again and went over to the driver's side and prepared to mount the charger. I knew from playing around with it that I had a lot of wiggle room. Another thing that was different for me compared to Chris' video is the attachment of the charger. In his video, there is a huge adhesive pad on the charger. I ordered the same one, but it came with 2 strips of velcro instead. I actually liked this better as it would allow removal or movement in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce it was installed and completely hooked up, I reconnected the battery and started the truck. Threw my phone in the center console and was greeted by a charging signal. Afterward, I cleaned and buttoned everything up. A very simple installation, only complicated by a small lack of foresight.\n\nLooking back, I spent more time driving to and from stores picking up incidentals to complete the project. I would suggest having some wire and fuses on hand if possible. Combined with cleaning afterward, I'd say it took about half an hour. Although I haven't had it long, I am sure I will be enjoying this addition.\n\nAll told from Amazon it cost $54.85. The fuses and wire were another $15, so less than $70. \n\nPending Delivery tomorrow, hopefully I will be able to hid the MA1 Dongle.", "Got what I needed to make the MA1 hidden! I should be able to pop the trim off, disconnect the USB-A, plug in the adapter and then button everything up.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trim took a little bit more effort than the sides of the center console, but I still managed not to scuff anything. With the connection exposed, I went to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nI continued to work on it for 10-15 minutes before giving up. I was getting close to the point where I was going to break something from applying too much pressure trying to disconnect the switch. For whatever reason, I could not figure out what or where was securing the connection and how to disengage it. Disappointed, but not willing to risk damaging anything, I buttoned it up and found my good double sided tape. I cut what I needed and mounted it where I could still disconnect if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not exactly what I was looking for, but I think I'll still be happy with it. Time will tell. At least now I do not have to worry about making that USB-A port functional after being disconnected.", "A quick follow up: The small strips of mounting adhesive on the wireless charging unit are prone to failure. The solution was applying 3 strips of Gorilla Glue's Clear mounting tape. It's held so far.\n\nOver the last week I've been slowly installing bits and pieces of the LED kit. I went with the OPT7 double row LED's. Once I was under the dash, I noticed there isn't a good place to install the light strips (I didn't want to put them on the knee airbag). I decided to use the existing LED mount under the driver's side dash. I cut a strip of 1/8\" hardwood the same dimensions as the light strip. Then I countersunk and drove a screw into a backer, sandwiching the existing mount between the 2 pieces of wood. Then I mounted the strip to the wood and also zip-tied it to the piece of wood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the front passenger dash, there was a decent place to hang it using the same method near the bottom of the glove box. I decided I wanted mine a little further up and towards the back of the footwell. Same procedure, except this time I glued and zip-tied the light strip first, before zip-tying it to some conveniently located mounting holes under the passenger side dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this, I checked for power through the cigarette lighter and everything looked good. I decided to run a fuse tap into fuse #6. and once I was done pulling wires and hooking everything back up - no power. I switched it into fuse #3, since I know it is working, but still no power.\n\nI don't know where things went awry, but I didn't have time to do much more today. I did have to bend the fuse tap so that it would fit into the location, so maybe I damaged it. I also did not have a good connector for the ground, so that could have been it too. There is also a chance I messed up the only 2 wires I had to deal with for power.\n\nLooking ahead, I would really like to sacrifice one of the 6 double row LED's and use it for the center console lighting if I can find an option. With Easter coming up, it could be another week before I'm able to deal with this again, so we'll see what happens.", "How have you been doing with the MA1?\n\nI have one and it has been sporadically not connecting.

I plan on installing wireless charging using Chris Dunning's video. Like Chris, I plan on using Fuse #3 to power the charger. \n\nI love the wireless Android Auto. The MA1 dongle is awesome, but I want to hide it utilizing the same method TrippMe has posted in the forum previously. This will potentially leave me with a dead USB A port, so my first question is this: Can I re-wire that USB port for power only by tapping the fuse box (Similar to the MA1)? My electrical experience is limited.\n\nI will also be installing ambient lighting in all 4 footwells, the front center console and hopefully the cupholders using a modified kit. I'd like to install something similar to this for center console lighting: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AFU4QF4/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=A6XWG1D8Q4A4V&psc=1 To be honest, I will need to make sure the light has more of a flood effect than a narrow cone, but I don't want to mount an entire strip of LED's.\n\nAnyway, I plan on using this thread to document and post pictures as I work on and complete the mods. Everything I needed for the wireless charging installation was delivered yesterday, so I'm hoping I'll be able to post pictures of completion this weekend. I appreciate all the work and conversations you've all had that allow me to research everything, and I'm hoping I can bounce some ideas off of you before or during the process(es).", "I finally got started on the wireless charger. First, I needed to make sure the charger wouldn't have any problem with varying thicknesses of material and inserts in the center console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter double and triple checking the fuse, amperage and tap orientation, away we went. The first issue came up shortly after opening the package to the adapter. I knew immediately the red wire was not going to be long enough. The only wire I had was white 18 ga. It had to be red, so down to the big box store I went.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came back and took off the fuse cover and passenger side console cover. This part was easy and painless. I started assembling the fuse tap and noticed the light yellow fuses were 20A fuses....not 7.5 like I had expected, so back to the store I went. Hopefully done with the driving, I re-checked the fuses and tap orientation and installed them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I felt like I was making progress. I hooked up the battery and checked for power. Power was confirmed, so I disconnected the battery again and went over to the driver's side and prepared to mount the charger. I knew from playing around with it that I had a lot of wiggle room. Another thing that was different for me compared to Chris' video is the attachment of the charger. In his video, there is a huge adhesive pad on the charger. I ordered the same one, but it came with 2 strips of velcro instead. I actually liked this better as it would allow removal or movement in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce it was installed and completely hooked up, I reconnected the battery and started the truck. Threw my phone in the center console and was greeted by a charging signal. Afterward, I cleaned and buttoned everything up. A very simple installation, only complicated by a small lack of foresight.\n\nLooking back, I spent more time driving to and from stores picking up incidentals to complete the project. I would suggest having some wire and fuses on hand if possible. Combined with cleaning afterward, I'd say it took about half an hour. Although I haven't had it long, I am sure I will be enjoying this addition.\n\nAll told from Amazon it cost $54.85. The fuses and wire were another $15, so less than $70. \n\nPending Delivery tomorrow, hopefully I will be able to hid the MA1 Dongle.", "Got what I needed to make the MA1 hidden!

The solution was applying 3 strips of Gorilla Glue's Clear mounting tape. It's held so far.\n\nOver the last week I've been slowly installing bits and pieces of the LED kit. I went with the OPT7 double row LED's. Once I was under the dash, I noticed there isn't a good place to install the light strips (I didn't want to put them on the knee airbag). I decided to use the existing LED mount under the driver's side dash. I cut a strip of 1/8\" hardwood the same dimensions as the light strip. Then I countersunk and drove a screw into a backer, sandwiching the existing mount between the 2 pieces of wood. Then I mounted the strip to the wood and also zip-tied it to the piece of wood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the front passenger dash, there was a decent place to hang it using the same method near the bottom of the glove box. I decided I wanted mine a little further up and towards the back of the footwell. Same procedure, except this time I glued and zip-tied the light strip first, before zip-tying it to some conveniently located mounting holes under the passenger side dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this, I checked for power through the cigarette lighter and everything looked good. I decided to run a fuse tap into fuse #6. and once I was done pulling wires and hooking everything back up - no power. I switched it into fuse #3, since I know it is working, but still no power.\n\nI don't know where things went awry, but I didn't have time to do much more today. I did have to bend the fuse tap so that it would fit into the location, so maybe I damaged it. I also did not have a good connector for the ground, so that could have been it too. There is also a chance I messed up the only 2 wires I had to deal with for power.\n\nLooking ahead, I would really like to sacrifice one of the 6 double row LED's and use it for the center console lighting if I can find an option. With Easter coming up, it could be another week before I'm able to deal with this again, so we'll see what happens.", "How have you been doing with the MA1?\n\nI have one and it has been sporadically not connecting.

Be content with heated seats and remote start, and leather wrap my current steering wheel as a DIY project.

I remember looking up the dash wiring and shows the harness for my car labeled as \"with dual zone climate\" even though I have single. I have considered buying a dual hvac and trying it but they usually sell for more, I like the button layout of the heated seats and wheel better on the single zone anyway so I had not looked into it further.

Everything else works though. I ended up selling that dual zone climate control to someone who bought a steering wheel kit to install in a 2022 Escape because they wanted the temp display on the dial and a heated wheel, so once that was installed along with the heated steering wheel we had it all working. The 2022 escape was an SE that had the convenience package but not the cold weather package so even though they did not have heated seats they were still able to have a heated steering wheel and we took the blanks for the heated seats from the old dual zone controls and swapped them. I am sure we could have added the heated seats as it looked like the wiring was there but we would have had to buy the heating elements and some wiring or at the very worst 2 used front seats which arent cheap even used.", "\n\nCdubya2020 said:\n\n\n\nHey guys I did a heated wheel swap on my 2020 ford escape, all the parts interchange with the maverick so I figured this would be useful here on the forum, there are some checks you can do to see if the wiring needed is there.

The Tux Mats are great for coverage and looks but leak easily around the retainer clips. There is no denying that. I poured a tiny amount of water in that area to show how easily they leak after a short contact with water. Tuxmat customer service said they shouldn't leak at the attachment points and the video was originally made to show them. If you compare them to the Smartliners for instance, the Smartliners are fully sealed around the clips making it impossible for water to leak at that spot. It all depends on if that is important or not to you but for the price I feel like they shouldn't leak. I live in northern Vermont and it is not uncommon at all to have a puddle of water on the mats as the snow and ice melts. I first discovered the leak out of curiosity as we had a very wet summer with large amounts of rain to where there was a little puddle on the passenger side mat from getting in and out a fair amount. I pulled the mat back after the rain to see and it was a bit wet underneath. At the very least they should have raised the area around the attachment point. I will say Tuxmat customer service was great and gave a full refund no issues.", "I feel like I just met a celebrity! It's a small maverick world.\n\nWe live in similar areas so while this is a small concern it seems like you'd have to get a pretty good amount of snow/water in there to \"fill\" the mat up to that attachment point, right? I guess I'll find out though.\n\nMy weathertechs in my other vehicle have straight up holes where they are retained. If snow was on top of those points it could def get under the liner.

However after they arrived, a tag on the product and the Mav owners manual, which I then found, say otherwise (risk of personal injury). \n\nAlthough not specific to this product or vehicle, my initial online queries yielded a mixed bag of opinions regarding if seat covers will affect safety or perhaps just the effectiveness of heated seats.

Part of getting max FE out of any EB engine is the ability to manually control to OD gears. Part of why I could get 26+ from my 2.7 F150.

Keeping a slightly higher rpm (target 1800-2200) at cruising speed kept the engine out of boost, and FE went up.

You will have to remove door panels and the roof liner. One nice thing, in a new car, all of the plastic clips are new, and pliable. In an older vehicles, these are much more prone to snapping. Its not important to cover the entire door skins from the inside (which is fortunate, because that would be darn near impossible) but (and this is kind of an oversimplification, but just to make a point) say you are only able to cover 40% of the inside of one of your doors.... This might be 90% effective. You do need some deadener inside of all 4 doors, your roof, and the back wall of your cab.\n\nAs for brands of sound deadener, if money doesn't matter to you, Dynamat works great. For something which is a lot cheaper, and IMPO, works just as well, I use Noico.\n\nI went for years without sound deadener in my truck, and thought I was okay without it. But about 2 years ago, I sound deadened it, and now I can't imagine ever going without it again ! Not only does it give you a much quieter noise floor, so that you can listen to music at a lower level and it still sounds great, but also, you can blast loud music / bass, and greatly eliminate all the interior rattles  Even aside from music, if you just want a quieter, more peaceful riding experience, deadener all the way ! \n\nPS, before I deadened my truck, a light knock on the door sounded like knocking on a steel trash can.

I am in wait mode on my XLT and driving a 14 year old daily driver Chevy HHR wagon that's about shot. Hopefully mine will be built in the spring, and I will get it during the summer. Nothing on my order will hold it up, no extras. I will likely keep it as cloth seats for a year or so after I get it to save for the leather covers.

The most complicated part of the process will be removing the cloth seat covers from your original Seats. Ive talked to local shops who have done Mav katzkin packages. Its a hog ring set up, so more time consuming than the one from that video (which ive watched before also). \n\nAs for warrenty, i\u2019m not certain what warrenty is being referred to\u2026 if its the seat fabric warrenty, yes for certain you would void it. Air bag? In the event of an emergency, nothing you\u2019re doing would prevent them from deploying unless you forget to reconnect the quick connect wiring when you put your seat back together. The bolts for the seats themselves are listed as one time use and would have to be replaced for that part of the warrenty\u2026 but honestly\u2026 the only warrenty issue that would ever come up is the seat fabric, which you void, and the electronic, which you\u2019d have to do some research on. But since like you said, the truck was designed for 12v modifications, there must be a way to do it without affecting warrenty. Likely with proper fuse rating usage.\n\npersonally i decided against installing myself, and ordering it installed with a katzkin interrior package through the dealer my truck is ordered through.

It's the nature of an LED bulb. A regular incandescent bulb has a higher resistance which allows it to turn on/off at a slower pace. The LED have virtually no resistance and thus you'll see the more rapid on/off. If you want to avoid the rapid flashing, you'll need to install resistors in the circuit. Usually, when you search for LED auto bulbs you'll also see recommendations to add those resistors.\n\nUPDATE: This is what I love about this forum ...

I like the idea of running the power cable once, and tapping this for the dashcam, and then later very easily for the mirror without doing another run.\n\nDashcam hardwire kits seem to be inconsistent in their wire gauge; some are smaller than 18ga. The VIOFO kit may be 16 gauge though. I'd rather make the long run with a solid copper cable like this and then tap from the end of that run as needed. Since I plan on using 7-8 feet of wire to carry 5 amps at 12 volts, it seems that's safe for 18-gauge. I figure I can use the relatively cheap (and thin) 18/3-wire solid copper thermostat cable from the fuse box and run it up to the generously spacious cavity, as shown by user @Jman Mavster in his thread here. I circled the cavity where I could stash my wiring, which could include a space for the chunky 12v to 5v adapter that comes with dashcam hardwire kits. I could snip the kit's power wires down to just a few inches to eliminate the extra resistance. I personally like using Wago connectors rather than crimping. I wired my whole detached garage with these, they are code compliant. Very convenient for modifying old work if necessary, and for experiments/projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like the idea of avoiding used fuses, so I was thinking of tapping the unused Micro3 fuse #1/2 since it's ignition-only, and then maybe tapping unused Micro2 fuse #20 for constant battery, and then a ground connection on one of the bolts next to the fuse box. Make the run with the 3-wire cable along the passenger A-pillar, and tuck it up behind the headliner, up through the BLIS compartment, and into the cavity in the screen shot above. Then connect everything as needed from there using the wago connectors. Dimming/homelink mirror can be conveniently connected later to these connectors as well.\n\nDo it make sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Extra note: Fuse #3 and #6 are the only Micro2 fuses that are ignition only, but they are used by the system. From other threads people seem to be tapping into these just fine, however, I haven't seen anyone prove which side of the fuses are line vs load, so I'm not sure if they are potentially bypassing their added-fuse and opening the possibility of blowing the system fuse on the tap, due to the orientation of their fuse-tap. It looks like they are stuck with only 1 option for orientation because of the plastic surrounding those fuses. My multimeter pinheads were too large to stick into the empty fuse slot to test line vs load, so I'd still like to know the answer for science.", "\n2022 Maverick Hybrid | Lariat Lux | Area 51 | Moonroof | Console Vault\n+ Truxedo X15 Soft Rollup, Mud Flaps (F/R), Floor Mats, Tailgate Dampener, Window Deflectors, Reverse LED Bulbs, Cargo/3rd Brake LED Bulbs, Viofo A129 Pro Duo Dashcam (hardwire install thread)\nConfirmation email 6/17 | Build scheduled email 7/29 | Scheduled for Build 9/13 [BUILT!] | Built email 12/11 | Shipped email 12/16 | Estimated Delivery by 1/8/2022 | Actual delivery 1/13 | Purchased 1/14/2022  $32k sticker / $34k OTD (North Carolina) no ADM [Not part of seat belt/gas tank recall].

At Home Depot I bought like 15 feet of cable for $5 lol. I think spending $30 on 16-ga stranded 3-wire would be totally reasonable (it's a less common cable) as well if you wanted a little more capacity for like a 7.5 or 10 amp fuse if you had a need for it with additional devices. I'm just using 5 amp fuses. The difference in thickness should not make any difference at all in running the cable in the available spaces. There's just plenty of space everywhere the cable needs to run including the A-pillar behind the airbag and under the headliner.\n\nIn reality, the easiest part of the entire process of running my cable (or any cable) was running it the fuse box, up passenger side A-Pillar, through the headliner and into the overhead plastic trim cavities. There is really nothing tricky about this part. Maybe the only annoying part is the extra piece of trim to be removed on the passenger side kinda adjacent to the glove box, in order to route the cable from the fuse area up to the A-pillar very easily. That tiny piece of trim has like 5 clips for some reason lol, and a small white plastic anchor pin on the bottom (dunno what to call it). Once you do it the first time it'll make sense how easy it actually is to pull it off, but it may seem confusing at first.\n\nThe A-pillar gives you plenty of room behind the airbag if you needed multiple runs, so that shouldn't really be a worry if you expect to make multiple runs. But again, the purpose of running the 3-wire 18ga cable is to basically locate a power source tap for both the dashcam and future dimming mirror in one spot overhead so I don't have to modify anything OEM at all, it can all be removed or updated later, and all from 1 run. I dislike the idea of using wire taps, personally, but that's just my preference; people seem to have no issue with doing that for the dimming mirror power. I felt more comfortable using fuse taps on unused system fuses and such.\n\nI recorded a whole lot of the entire process, and I hope to edit that video sometime this week/weekend!\n\nThe hardest part honestly was running the cable to the rear dashcam. I decided to run the cable on the lower trim on the driver's side. I had to remove/loosen a good bit of trim and there are a few more tricky obstacles (at least in how I did it). Luckily I had just enough slack to reach the dashcam. I'm not sure if you can run it along the upper headliner instead, that's possibly even easier, but I just decided to go for the lower trim route.\n\nSorry I don't have many pics, all the imagery is tied up in video heh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n2022 Maverick Hybrid | Lariat Lux | Area 51 | Moonroof | Console Vault\n+ Truxedo X15 Soft Rollup, Mud Flaps (F/R), Floor Mats, Tailgate Dampener, Window Deflectors, Reverse LED Bulbs, Cargo/3rd Brake LED Bulbs, Viofo A129 Pro Duo Dashcam (hardwire install thread)\nConfirmation email 6/17 | Build scheduled email 7/29 | Scheduled for Build 9/13 [BUILT!] | Built email 12/11 | Shipped email 12/16 | Estimated Delivery by 1/8/2022 | Actual delivery 1/13 | Purchased 1/14/2022  $32k sticker / $34k OTD (North Carolina) no ADM [Not part of seat belt/gas tank recall].

At Home Depot I bought like 15 feet of cable for $5 lol. I think spending $30 on 16-ga stranded 3-wire would be totally reasonable (it's a less common cable) as well if you wanted a little more capacity for like a 7.5 or 10 amp fuse if you had a need for it with additional devices. I'm just using 5 amp fuses. The difference in thickness should not make any difference at all in running the cable in the available spaces. There's just plenty of space everywhere the cable needs to run including the A-pillar behind the airbag and under the headliner.\n\nIn reality, the easiest part of the entire process of running my cable (or any cable) was running it the fuse box, up passenger side A-Pillar, through the headliner and into the overhead plastic trim cavities. There is really nothing tricky about this part. Maybe the only annoying part is the extra piece of trim to be removed on the passenger side kinda adjacent to the glove box, in order to route the cable from the fuse area up to the A-pillar very easily. That tiny piece of trim has like 5 clips for some reason lol, and a small white plastic anchor pin on the bottom (dunno what to call it). Once you do it the first time it'll make sense how easy it actually is to pull it off, but it may seem confusing at first.\n\nThe A-pillar gives you plenty of room behind the airbag if you needed multiple runs, so that shouldn't really be a worry if you expect to make multiple runs. But again, the purpose of running the 3-wire 18ga cable is to basically locate a power source tap for both the dashcam and future dimming mirror in one spot overhead so I don't have to modify anything OEM at all, it can all be removed or updated later, and all from 1 run. I dislike the idea of using wire taps, personally, but that's just my preference; people seem to have no issue with doing that for the dimming mirror power. I felt more comfortable using fuse taps on unused system fuses and such.\n\nI recorded a whole lot of the entire process, and I hope to edit that video sometime this week/weekend!\n\nThe hardest part honestly was running the cable to the rear dashcam. I decided to run the cable on the lower trim on the driver's side. I had to remove/loosen a good bit of trim and there are a few more tricky obstacles (at least in how I did it). Luckily I had just enough slack to reach the dashcam. I'm not sure if you can run it along the upper headliner instead, that's possibly even easier, but I just decided to go for the lower trim route.\n\nSorry I don't have many pics, all the imagery is tied up in video heh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n2022 Maverick Hybrid | Lariat Lux | Area 51 | Moonroof | Console Vault\n+ Truxedo X15 Soft Rollup, Mud Flaps (F/R), Floor Mats, Tailgate Dampener, Window Deflectors, Reverse LED Bulbs, Cargo/3rd Brake LED Bulbs, Viofo A129 Pro Duo Dashcam (hardwire install thread)\nConfirmation email 6/17 | Build scheduled email 7/29 | Scheduled for Build 9/13 [BUILT!] | Built email 12/11 | Shipped email 12/16 | Estimated Delivery by 1/8/2022 | Actual delivery 1/13 | Purchased 1/14/2022  $32k sticker / $34k OTD (North Carolina) no ADM [Not part of seat belt/gas tank recall].

I like the idea of running the power cable once, and tapping this for the dashcam, and then later very easily for the mirror without doing another run.\n\nDashcam hardwire kits seem to be inconsistent in their wire gauge; some are smaller than 18ga. The VIOFO kit may be 16 gauge though. I'd rather make the long run with a solid copper cable like this and then tap from the end of that run as needed. Since I plan on using 7-8 feet of wire to carry 5 amps at 12 volts, it seems that's safe for 18-gauge. I figure I can use the relatively cheap (and thin) 18/3-wire solid copper thermostat cable from the fuse box and run it up to the generously spacious cavity, as shown by user @Jman Mavster in his thread here. I circled the cavity where I could stash my wiring, which could include a space for the chunky 12v to 5v adapter that comes with dashcam hardwire kits. I could snip the kit's power wires down to just a few inches to eliminate the extra resistance. I personally like using Wago connectors rather than crimping. I wired my whole detached garage with these, they are code compliant. Very convenient for modifying old work if necessary, and for experiments/projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like the idea of avoiding used fuses, so I was thinking of tapping the unused Micro3 fuse #1/2 since it's ignition-only, and then maybe tapping unused Micro2 fuse #20 for constant battery, and then a ground connection on one of the bolts next to the fuse box. Make the run with the 3-wire cable along the passenger A-pillar, and tuck it up behind the headliner, up through the BLIS compartment, and into the cavity in the screen shot above. Then connect everything as needed from there using the wago connectors. Dimming/homelink mirror can be conveniently connected later to these connectors as well.\n\nDo it make sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Extra note: Fuse #3 and #6 are the only Micro2 fuses that are ignition only, but they are used by the system. From other threads people seem to be tapping into these just fine, however, I haven't seen anyone prove which side of the fuses are line vs load, so I'm not sure if they are potentially bypassing their added-fuse and opening the possibility of blowing the system fuse on the tap, due to the orientation of their fuse-tap. It looks like they are stuck with only 1 option for orientation because of the plastic surrounding those fuses. My multimeter pinheads were too large to stick into the empty fuse slot to test line vs load, so I'd still like to know the answer for science.\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\nLine is on the bottom, load is on the top on #20. I used the blue/red wire on the bottom loom for 12v and the yellow/green wire from the bottom loom for switched.\n\n\n\n\n"], "https://www.mavericktruckclub.com/forum/threads/maverick-hybrid-floor-mats-same-as-ecoboost.7774/": ["Hey y\u2019all was wondering if anyone knows if there are mats for the hybrid version of the truck?

When demand is higher there isn't really an increase in supply to match it--instead prices go up and some products stop using leather and balance is restored.

The original upholstery is installed as a cover (with zippers and other connectors), so you are basically replacing the existing seat cover that goes directly over the foam.\n\nThere are videos of people doing installation themselves. For popular models you can sometimes buy the set of covers from eBay (Katzkins doesn't want to sell them to you directly) and people have recorded the process. You start by removing the seats from the vehicle, then remove the existing covers (sometimes requires breaking some plastic brackets). Installing the new ones is mostly about slipping them on and aligning them carefully (which can take some wrestling) and the attaching them. Sometimes that involves hog staples and a crimping tool, and sometimes you can re-use the plastic brackets that were there. If you do it carefully you could even re-install the original covers later if you wanted to for some reason (or trade between XL and XLT, for example).\n\nSo it's not like an installer is going in there with loose sheets of leather and stitching it in place, but it's more involved than slipping on a typical cover and clipping a few straps in place.", "6/21: ordered XL Hybrid w/Co-Pilot360, spray-in bedliner, tow hitch receiver, bed mat\n6/26: changed to XLT, 7/6: added Lux package\n8/31: remove bed mat, 10/11: removed Lux package (added tow hitch, floor mats)\n10/21: scheduled for week of 12/13 (priority dropped to 02 on 10/13)\nfinal order: XLT Hybrid in Area 51 w/Co-Pilot360, tow hitch receiver, floor mats", "Love the look, but here in Texas I don't want leather seats again.", "I seen to many issue with old leather.

I bought the used wheel on eBay for $215 and it took about 45 minutes to complete the swap.\n\nDisconnect the battery and wait about 15 mins for the energy to dissipate.\n\nThere are two 8mm bolts on the bottom of the steering column trim, remove those and slide the lower trim piece towards the front of the car. This will separate the trim pieces. Now you can turn the steering wheel 90 degrees to access the port where the airbag clip is. Use a slim flathead screwdriver and start at the outside edge of the port pushing the screwdriver until it makes contact with the airbag. Now slide the screwdriver towards the inside of the port, and this will release the clip for the airbag. Turn the wheel now 180 degrees to access the second port and repeat the process.\n\nThe airbag will now be able to be pulled out. There are three connectors that are easy to remove, and the airbag is free. Next remove the steering wheel control connector from the steering column.\n\nRe center your wheels and steering wheel before removing the steering wheel.\n\nMy steering wheel was held in place with a large hex bolt, believe it was around a 21mm, although I have read that some new Fords are using a T50 torx. Remove that bolt and the steering wheel will pull of easily.\n\nNow you need to swap the steering wheel controls from the old wheel to the new wheel. This was the most time intensive part. The matte black trim ring will get removed, but the trim at 6 o'clock stays in the place. Starting at the 9 o'clock steering wheel control, gently pry upwards to start dislodging the trim piece. Now use a small flathead screwdriver to pry the clips upward gently as you keep pressure on the trim piece. Work in a clockwise direction to remove the trim. There are a total of 4 small torx, T8 I believe that hold the controls in once you get the trim removed. Take those torx out and swap the Maverick control packs into the Escape trim, tighten the torx and click the Escape trim now containing the Maverick controls into the Escape wheel. Route the cables into their original positions.\n\nOn the steering column there is a black plastic piece that spins, it might be the clock spring. This also holds the connector for the controls. There are 2 male plastic pins that align into the steering wheel. Make sure the connector port is at 12 o'clock and slide the new steering wheel into place. Reinstall in the hex bolt and torque to 36 foot pounds. There was no thread additive on the bolt I removed, and I did not install any when I reinstalled.\n\nConnect the steering wheel controls, then the airbag connectors and click the airbag into place. You will feel the spring tabs engage when the airbag is fully inserted.\n\nHope this helps, I can re do the process and take photos if needed.\n\nThe reason I did not apply thread locker to the bolt was because in the event of a warranty claim, I will swap back to the OEM steering wheel before going into the dealer. It is my understanding that with the battery disconnected, and the airbag removed/reinstalled before restoring power, that there is no record of the airbag being removed from the vehicle.", "I will add that the Escape wheel had the 360 Co-Pilot controls, my maverick did not. The first attempt was to utilize the Escape controls, but that did not work. Both sides of the steering wheel controls were unresponsive.
